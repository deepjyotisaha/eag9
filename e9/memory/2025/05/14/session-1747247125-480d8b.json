First, it considers Tesla Motors\u2019 shifting strategies in respect of patent law, policy, and practice. Second, the paper explores Tesla Motors\u2019 embrace of an open source philosophy. Third, it analyses the larger issues about business development. Fourth, the paper examines Tesla Motors\u2019 use of trade mark law and related rights in its marketing and branding. Fifth, this paper concludes by considering Tesla Motors in light of larger initiatives in respect of clean technologies, renewable energy and climate change. Of particular note is sustainable transportation; the development of a Gigafactory; and Elon Musk\u2019s complementary work at SolarCity in promoting solar technologies. 1.

In its annual report for 2012, the company explains its intellectual property portfolio in respect of its technology: Our battery pack and electric powertrain system has enabled us to deliver market-leading range capability on our vehicles at what we believe is a compelling battery cost per kilowatt-hour. Our battery packs use commercially available lithium-ion battery cells and contain two to three times the energy of any other commercially available electric vehicle battery pack, thereby significantly increasing the range capabilities of our vehicles. Designing an electric powertrain and a vehicle to exploit its energy efficiency has required extensive safety testing and innovation in battery packs, motors, powertrain systems and vehicle engineering.
