And now we have added EAG, a course dedicated to Agents, to this list!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis comprehensive 20-session course equips students to build advanced Agentic AI systems, capable of autonomous decision-making, task orchestration, and seamless interaction within complex web environments. Unlike traditional AI programs, this curriculum focuses on designing browser-based agents that leverage the latest advancements in LLMs, retrieval-augmented systems, and multi-agent collaboration, preparing students to lead the development of next-generation AI solutions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThrough hands-on experience with cutting-edge tools like SmolAgents, LangChain, OpenAI Evals, Selenium/Playwright, and retrieval-augmented frameworks (RAGs), students rapidly progress from foundational concepts to real-world applications. The course emphasizes creating end-to-end systems, where AI agents autonomously browse, retrieve, and reason across diverse web-based contexts, all while ensuring state management, error correction, and optimal performance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom advanced prompt engineering and knowledge graphs to vision-based interaction and multi-modal AI systems, the curriculum is aligned with the latest trends in the industry. The capstone project challenges students to design and deploy a fully autonomous browser assistant, demonstrating their expertise in creating scalable and intelligent Agentic AI systems. Key features include: **Agentic Intelligence Focus, Modern Automation Toolsets, and Real-World Relevance**!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe EAG course offers a revolutionary approach to learning AI, enabling students to design agents that mirror human-like intelligence in interacting with the web, bridging the gap between theory and application.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEAG V2 will start in **August 2025**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEAG V1/V2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| Lecture Title |\\\\\\\\n|---|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| Session 1: Foundations of the Transformer Architecture - A deep dive into the self-attention mechanism and why Transformers revolutionized NLP. |\\\\\\\\n| Session 2: Modern Language Model Internals - Examines pre-training objectives, parameter scaling, and advanced fine-tuning for LLMs. |\\\\\\\\n| Session 3: Introduction to Agentic AI - Overviews AI agents that plan, reason, and take actions beyond simple text generation. |\\\\\\\\n| Session 4: Planning and Reasoning with Language Models - Covers chain-of-thought prompting, multi-step reasoning, and structured thinking in LLMs. |\\\\\\\\n| Session 5: Agent Architecture \\\\\\\\u2013 Cognitive Layers - Explores layered designs for perception, memory, and action to build robust AI agents. |\\\\\\\\n| Session 6: Memory, Context, and State Management - Focuses on methods (vector stores, retrieval-augmented generation) for handling extended context. |\\\\\\\\n| Session 7: Tool Use and External APIs - Shows how agents can call external tools or APIs (including Python scripts) to augment capabilities. |\\\\\\\\n| Session 8: Reinforcement Learning for Agentic Behaviors - Introduces RL frameworks that let agents learn and adapt through trial and error. |\\\\\\\\n| Session 9: Advanced Prompt Engineering & Auto-Prompting - Teaches sophisticated prompting tactics, sub-prompts, and self-improving prompt loops. |\\\\\\\\n| Session 10: Retrieval-Augmented and Knowledge-Graph Agents - Examines how external knowledge sources (search, databases, graphs) ground agent outputs. |\\\\\\\\n| Session 11: Understanding Browser Based Agents - Introduces AI-powered browser assistants and demonstrates their high-level architecture. |\\\\\\\\n| Session 12: Fundamentals of Web Page Parsing - Presents core HTML parsing, DOM traversal, and techniques to extract meaningful data from pages. |\\\\\\\\n| Session 13: Context Maintenance in Browsers - Shows how to persist and manage session data while browsing across multiple tabs/sites. |\\\\\\\\n| Session 14: Building Browser-Aware Agents - Covers leveraging browser-specific APIs to let agents navigate, click, and interact with pages. |\\\\\\\\n| Session 15: Introduction to Browser Automation Tools - Surveys Selenium, Puppeteer, and Playwright, focusing on bridging them with agentic frameworks. |\\\\\\\\n| Session 16: Intelligent Goal Interpretation - Explores designing agents that align web automation tasks with user-defined objectives. |\\\\\\\\n| Session 17: Multi-Agent Systems and Collaboration - Demonstrates how multiple agents can coordinate across different browser tasks or subtasks. |\\\\\\\\n| Session 18: Managing Uncertainty and Error Correction - Equips you with strategies for handling dynamic web structures, unexpected failures, and retries. |\\\\\\\\n| Session 19: Advanced Task Orchestration - Guides you through synchronizing tasks, tabs, and user interactions in real time. |\\\\\\\\n| Session 20: Capstone \\\\\\\\u2013 (Probably) Autonomous Browser Assistant - Challenges you to design, build, and demo a fully functioning browser-based AI with advanced features. |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis revamped 30-session course transforms students into full-stack AI engineers, blending foundational knowledge with cutting-edge tools and practical deployment skills. Unlike the previous version, which focused on core theory, this new curriculum integrates MLOps, CI/CD, and end-to-end deployment across various platforms, ensuring students are equipped for real-world applications.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy leveraging modern coding tools like Cursor and Clade dev, students accelerate their development, gaining hands-on experience from day one. The course emphasizes parallel learning in frontend, backend, and AI modeling, ensuring students develop the comprehensive skill set required to deploy scalable AI solutions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom neural networks and LLMs to generative AI and deployment strategies, the curriculum reflects the latest industry trends. The capstone project allows students to apply their knowledge in practical scenarios, demonstrating their readiness for the fast-evolving world of AI.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nKey features include: a Full-Stack Focus; Modern Toolsets; and Real-World Relevance!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nERA V3 started on 12th October and scheduled to finish in July 2025!
