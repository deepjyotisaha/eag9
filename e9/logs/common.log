You are a perception engine helping an AI agent to decide which MCP server(s) are most relevant to a user's query.

üîß MCP Server Catalog:
- math: Most used Math tools, including special string-int conversions, fibonacci, python sandbox, shell and sql related tools
- documents: Load, search and extract within webpages, local PDFs or other documents. Web and document specialist
- websearch: Webtools to search internet for queries and fetch content for a specific web page

üß† User Query:
"How much Anmol singh paid for his DLF apartment via Capbridge? "

üéØ Your Tasks:
- Identify the INTENT of the user's query.
- Extract important ENTITIES (e.g., company names, numbers, concepts).
- Suggest a TOOL_HINT if you can guess a useful tool (optional).
- Pick the most relevant MCP server IDs from the catalog above.
- Suggest queries that can be looked up in the cached memory which can help perform the task better, this can be used for the following:
  1. Add additonal information which is not already present in the current query, but may be present in cached memory
  2. Similar queries which have already been solved might have some parts of the answer or the complete answer which might be helpful
  3. Any additional information which might be needed

üìã Your Output Format (in JSON):
{
  "intent": "...",
  "entities": [...],
  "tool_hint": "...",
  "selected_servers": ["server1", "server2"]
  "memory_lookup_queries": ["What information is available on God of Cricket", "What other sports are peferred by the user"]

  "useful_results": ["Result 1: The sum of 8 and 10 is 10 which may be helpful in answering log of sum of 10 and 8"
                     "Result 2: Tesla is a publicly listed company with symbol TSLA"]
}

‚úÖ Rules:
- selected_servers must match server IDs exactly (e.g., server1, server2).
- If none are a clear match, select all servers.
- Keep output short and clean.
- Maintain session_memory_snapshot to capture what has been done so far and what was the outcome of the steps
- Maintain useful_results to capture all the useful information obtained so far which can help solve the user query
- Never overwrite previous session_memory_snapshot or previous useful_results, always append to it.
- If you have valid answers from tool calls, they are success

You are: Reasoning-driven AI Agent

üéØ Goal: Return ONLY ONE async Python function `solve()` that resolves the user query in EXACTLY ONE-GO using ONLY available tools.

 
Approach:
1. Analyze Query ‚Üí Break into tool-solvable sub-tasks.
2. Check Session Memory ‚Üí What sub-tasks were already solved 
3. Evaluate lifelines ‚Üí if there were tool/sandbox execution failures or errors? How many lifelines left?
4. Evaluate number of steps ‚Üí How many steps consumed, how many left?  
3. Review Perception Inputs ‚Üí Identify suggested next tasks.
4. Define solve() ‚Üí Solve in one execution - either conclude or implement next steps

üß† User Query: "How much Anmol singh paid for his DLF apartment via Capbridge? "

üîß Tools Available: - duckduckgo_search_results: Search DuckDuckGo. Usage: input={"input": {"query": "latest AI developments", "max_results": 5} } result = await mcp.call_tool('duckduckgo_search_results', input)
- download_raw_html_from_url: Fetch webpage content. Usage: input={"input": {"url": "https://example.com"} } result = await mcp.call_tool('download_raw_html_from_url', input)
- search_stored_documents: Search documents to get relevant extracts. Usage: input={"input": {"query": "your query"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('search_stored_documents', input)

‚è≥ Steps & Lifelines
- You have a total of 3 steps to solve the user query
- You are currently at step number 1
- You have currently 3 lifelines left in the current step

üìã Perception Inputs: intent='Determine the amount Anmol Singh paid for a DLF apartment via Capbridge.' entities=['Anmol Singh', 'DLF apartment', 'Capbridge'] tool_hint='websearch' tags=[] selected_servers=['websearch', 'documents'] memory_lookup_queries=['Information about Anmol Singh investments', 'Capbridge deals and real estate investments', 'DLF apartment sales prices']

Inside the solve() function, you can choose ONLY ONE of the following patterns, but cannot mix patterns in a single solve() implementation:
1. Sequential dependency: Chain tool outputs until final result, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"
2. Independent sequential: Merge results in final answer, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: Wikipedia says {tool_result_a}. News says {tool_result_b}"
3. Fetch information chunk: Obtain information chunks using tools, NEVER parse or prcocess further if similar attempts failed, ALWAYS return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
4. Session memory summary: Use session memory and stored content to return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {summarized_content}" If your final answer is from cache data then add the following line to the final answer - "[NOTE: This answer was obtained from cached results due to tool error encountered during execution]"

‚ùóLook for sandbox errors or tool execution errors in "Session Memory", if you had ERRORS AND if you have just "1" lifeline left in the "current step":
1. You have access to function "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" which obtains the result of the specified tool_name from cache memory, and this works best for fetching content or informtion chunks either from web or documents  
2. Ignore the above patterns completely, and fetch the tool result from cached memory using the following code "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" and return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {cached_result}.

NOTE: Session Memory is the current working memory, and Cache Memory is an alternate source to fetch tool outputs if sandbox or tool execution fails.


‚úÖ Sample Format for solve(): 
```python
import json
async def solve():
    # PLAN:
    """ 
    <Add a descriptive plan here which describes the logic for solve(), and includes the pattern#, steps involved and reasoning, error handling and fallback options. You must include how you are relying on cached result when running out of lifelines>

    """
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Convert characters to ASCII values. Usage: input={"input": {"string": "INDIA"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"string": "INDIA"}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)

    # FINAL_RESULT
    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"

```

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Validate PLAN against rules.
- Follow exact Usage docstring format for tool calls.
- Use only available tools from Tool Catalog.
- Call tools by name (await mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)).
- Precede calls with full docstring ("""docstring""").
- Use function signature (tool(input)).
- Parse dependent results (parsed = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]). (NEVER use ["results"], ALWAYS USE ["result"])
- Never inline json.loads(...) in f-strings; assign to variable first.
- NEVER parse document/webpage chunks to look for FINAL_ANSWER OR chain more tools based on result, always return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
- NEVER use "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" & "mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)" in the same solve() function
- NEVER return document/webpage chunks OR FAILURE/ERROR Messages in FINAL_ANSWER.
- NEVER return FINAL_ANSWER without the user query being solved if you have steps left to try out.

üéØ Your Tasks:
- Identify the INTENT of the user's query.
- Extract important ENTITIES (e.g., company names, numbers, concepts).
- Suggest a TOOL_HINT if you can guess a useful tool (optional).
- Pick the most relevant MCP server IDs from the catalog above.
- Suggest queries that can be looked up in the cached memory which can help perform the task better, this can be used for the following:
  1. Add additonal information which is not already present in the current query, but may be present in cached memory
  2. Similar queries which have already been solved might have some parts of the answer or the complete answer which might be helpful
  3. Any additional information which might be needed

You are: Reasoning-driven AI Agent

üéØ Goal: Return ONLY ONE async Python function `solve()` that resolves the user query in EXACTLY ONE-GO using ONLY available tools.

 
Approach:
1. Analyze Query ‚Üí Break into tool-solvable sub-tasks.
2. Check Session Memory ‚Üí What sub-tasks were already solved 
3. Evaluate lifelines ‚Üí if there were tool/sandbox execution failures or errors? How many lifelines left?
4. Evaluate number of steps ‚Üí How many steps consumed, how many left?  
3. Review Perception Inputs ‚Üí Identify suggested next tasks.
4. Define solve() ‚Üí Solve in one execution - either conclude or implement next steps

üß† User Query: "How much Anmol singh paid for his DLF apartment via Capbridge? "

üîß Tools Available: - duckduckgo_search_results: Search DuckDuckGo. Usage: input={"input": {"query": "latest AI developments", "max_results": 5} } result = await mcp.call_tool('duckduckgo_search_results', input)
- download_raw_html_from_url: Fetch webpage content. Usage: input={"input": {"url": "https://example.com"} } result = await mcp.call_tool('download_raw_html_from_url', input)
- search_stored_documents: Search documents to get relevant extracts. Usage: input={"input": {"query": "your query"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('search_stored_documents', input)
- convert_webpage_url_into_markdown: Return clean webpage content without Ads, and clutter. Usage: input={{"input": {{"url": "https://example.com"}}}} result = await mcp.call_tool('convert_webpage_url_into_markdown', input)
- extract_pdf: Convert PDF to markdown. Usage: input={"input": {"file_path": "documents/sample.pdf"} } result = await mcp.call_tool('extract_pdf', input)

üîç Session Memory:
- Started new session with input: How much Anmol singh paid for his DLF apartment via Capbridge?  at 2025-05-13T15:25:04.200391
- Output of solve_sandbox: {'result': "[sandbox error: string indices must be integers, not 'str']"}

‚è≥ Steps & Lifelines
- You have a total of 3 steps to solve the user query
- You are currently at step number 1
- You have currently 2 lifelines left in the current step

üìã Perception Inputs: intent='Determine the price Anmol Singh paid for a DLF apartment through Capbridge.' entities=['Anmol Singh', 'DLF apartment', 'Capbridge'] tool_hint='websearch and then document retrieval to extract the specific price from the content of the page.' tags=[] selected_servers=['websearch', 'documents'] memory_lookup_queries=['Transactions involving Anmol Singh', 'Real estate investments made via Capbridge', 'DLF apartment sales prices']

Inside the solve() function, you can choose ONLY ONE of the following patterns, but cannot mix patterns in a single solve() implementation:
1. Sequential dependency: Chain tool outputs until final result, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"
2. Independent sequential: Merge results in final answer, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: Wikipedia says {tool_result_a}. News says {tool_result_b}"
3. Fetch information chunk: Obtain information chunks using tools, NEVER parse or prcocess further if similar attempts failed, ALWAYS return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
4. Session memory summary: Use session memory and stored content to return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {summarized_content}" If your final answer is from cache data then add the following line to the final answer - "[NOTE: This answer was obtained from cached results due to tool error encountered during execution]"

‚ùóLook for sandbox errors or tool execution errors in "Session Memory", if you had ERRORS AND if you have just "1" lifeline left in the "current step":
1. You have access to function "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" which obtains the result of the specified tool_name from cache memory, and this works best for fetching content or informtion chunks either from web or documents  
2. Ignore the above patterns completely, and fetch the tool result from cached memory using the following code "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" and return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {cached_result}.

NOTE: Session Memory is the current working memory, and Cache Memory is an alternate source to fetch tool outputs if sandbox or tool execution fails.


‚úÖ Sample Format for solve(): 
```python
import json
async def solve():
    # PLAN:
    """ 
    <Add a descriptive plan here which describes the logic for solve(), and includes the pattern#, steps involved and reasoning, error handling and fallback options. You must include how you are relying on cached result when running out of lifelines>

    """
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Convert characters to ASCII values. Usage: input={"input": {"string": "INDIA"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"string": "INDIA"}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)
    numbers = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    final_result = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FINAL_RESULT
    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"

```

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Validate PLAN against rules.
- Follow exact Usage docstring format for tool calls.
- Use only available tools from Tool Catalog.
- Call tools by name (await mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)).
- Precede calls with full docstring ("""docstring""").
- Use function signature (tool(input)).
- Parse dependent results (parsed = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]). (NEVER use ["results"], ALWAYS USE ["result"])
- Never inline json.loads(...) in f-strings; assign to variable first.
- NEVER parse document/webpage chunks to look for FINAL_ANSWER OR chain more tools based on result, always return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
- NEVER use "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" & "mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)" in the same solve() function
- NEVER return document/webpage chunks OR FAILURE/ERROR Messages in FINAL_ANSWER.
- NEVER return FINAL_ANSWER without the user query being solved if you have steps left to try out.

You are: Reasoning-driven AI Agent

üéØ Goal: Return ONLY ONE async Python function `solve()` that resolves the user query in EXACTLY ONE-GO using ONLY available tools.

 
Approach:
1. Analyze Query ‚Üí Break into tool-solvable sub-tasks.
2. Check Session Memory ‚Üí What sub-tasks were already solved 
3. Evaluate lifelines ‚Üí if there were tool/sandbox execution failures or errors? How many lifelines left?
4. Evaluate number of steps ‚Üí How many steps consumed, how many left?  
3. Review Perception Inputs ‚Üí Identify suggested next tasks.
4. Define solve() ‚Üí Solve in one execution - either conclude or implement next steps

üß† User Query: "How much Anmol singh paid for his DLF apartment via Capbridge? "

üîß Tools Available: - duckduckgo_search_results: Search DuckDuckGo. Usage: input={"input": {"query": "latest AI developments", "max_results": 5} } result = await mcp.call_tool('duckduckgo_search_results', input)
- download_raw_html_from_url: Fetch webpage content. Usage: input={"input": {"url": "https://example.com"} } result = await mcp.call_tool('download_raw_html_from_url', input)

- Output of solve_sandbox: {'result': "[sandbox error: run_python_sandbox.<locals>.get_tool_results_from_cache() got an unexpected keyword argument 'input']"}

‚è≥ Steps & Lifelines
- You have a total of 3 steps to solve the user query
- You are currently at step number 1
- You have currently 1 lifelines left in the current step

üìã Perception Inputs: intent='Find the price Anmol Singh paid for a DLF apartment through Capbridge.' entities=['Anmol Singh', 'DLF apartment', 'Capbridge', 'price'] tool_hint='websearch' tags=[] selected_servers=['websearch'] memory_lookup_queries=['What is Capbridge?', 'Recent real estate transactions involving Anmol Singh', 'DLF apartment prices in specific locations']

Inside the solve() function, you can choose ONLY ONE of the following patterns, but cannot mix patterns in a single solve() implementation:
1. Sequential dependency: Chain tool outputs until final result, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"
2. Independent sequential: Merge results in final answer, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: Wikipedia says {tool_result_a}. News says {tool_result_b}"
3. Fetch information chunk: Obtain information chunks using tools, NEVER parse or prcocess further if similar attempts failed, ALWAYS return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
4. Session memory summary: Use session memory and stored content to return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {summarized_content}" If your final answer is from cache data then add the following line to the final answer - "[NOTE: This answer was obtained from cached results due to tool error encountered during execution]"

‚ùóLook for sandbox errors or tool execution errors in "Session Memory", if you had ERRORS AND if you have just "1" lifeline left in the "current step":
1. You have access to function "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" which obtains the result of the specified tool_name from cache memory, and this works best for fetching content or informtion chunks either from web or documents  
2. Ignore the above patterns completely, and fetch the tool result from cached memory using the following code "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" and return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {cached_result}.

NOTE: Session Memory is the current working memory, and Cache Memory is an alternate source to fetch tool outputs if sandbox or tool execution fails.


‚úÖ Sample Format for solve(): 
```python
import json
async def solve():
    # PLAN:
    """ 
    <Add a descriptive plan here which describes the logic for solve(), and includes the pattern#, steps involved and reasoning, error handling and fallback options. You must include how you are relying on cached result when running out of lifelines>

    """
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Convert characters to ASCII values. Usage: input={"input": {"string": "INDIA"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"string": "INDIA"}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)
    numbers = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FUNCTION_CALL: 2
    """Sum exponentials of int list. Usage: input={"input": {"numbers": [65, 66, 67]}} result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"numbers": numbers}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)
    final_result = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FINAL_RESULT
    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"

```

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Validate PLAN against rules.
- Follow exact Usage docstring format for tool calls.
- Use only available tools from Tool Catalog.
- Call tools by name (await mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)).
- Precede calls with full docstring ("""docstring""").
- Use function signature (tool(input)).
- Parse dependent results (parsed = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]). (NEVER use ["results"], ALWAYS USE ["result"])
- Never inline json.loads(...) in f-strings; assign to variable first.
- NEVER parse document/webpage chunks to look for FINAL_ANSWER OR chain more tools based on result, always return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
- NEVER use "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" & "mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)" in the same solve() function
- NEVER return document/webpage chunks OR FAILURE/ERROR Messages in FINAL_ANSWER.
- NEVER return FINAL_ANSWER without the user query being solved if you have steps left to try out.

üéØ Your Tasks:
- Identify the INTENT of the user's query.
- Extract important ENTITIES (e.g., company names, numbers, concepts).
- Suggest a TOOL_HINT if you can guess a useful tool (optional).
- Pick the most relevant MCP server IDs from the catalog above.
- Suggest queries that can be looked up in the cached memory which can help perform the task better, this can be used for the following:
  1. Add additonal information which is not already present in the current query, but may be present in cached memory
  2. Similar queries which have already been solved might have some parts of the answer or the complete answer which might be helpful
  3. Any additional information which might be needed

üìã Your Output Format (in JSON):

}

‚úÖ Rules:
- selected_servers must match server IDs exactly (e.g., server1, server2).
- If none are a clear match, select all servers.
- Keep output short and clean.
- Maintain session_memory_snapshot to capture what has been done so far and what was the outcome of the steps
- Maintain useful_results to capture all the useful information obtained so far which can help solve the user query
- Never overwrite previous session_memory_snapshot or previous useful_results, always append to it.

1. You have access to function "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" which obtains the result of the specified tool_name from cache memory, and this works best for fetching content or informtion chunks either from web or documents  
2. Ignore the above patterns completely, and fetch the tool result from cached memory using the following code "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" and return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {cached_result}.

NOTE: Session Memory is the current working memory, and Cache Memory is an alternate source to fetch tool outputs if sandbox or tool execution fails.

    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Convert characters to ASCII values. Usage: input={"input": {"string": "INDIA"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)"""

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Validate PLAN against rules.
- Follow exact Usage docstring format for tool calls.
- Use only available tools from Tool Catalog.
- Call tools by name (await mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)).
- Precede calls with full docstring ("""docstring""").
- Use function signature (tool(input)).
- Parse dependent results (parsed = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]). (NEVER use ["results"], ALWAYS USE ["result"])
- Never inline json.loads(...) in f-strings; assign to variable first.
- NEVER parse document/webpage chunks to look for FINAL_ANSWER OR chain more tools based on result, always return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
- NEVER use "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" & "mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)" in the same solve() function
- NEVER return document/webpage chunks OR FAILURE/ERROR Messages in FINAL_ANSWER.
- NEVER return FINAL_ANSWER without the user query being solved if you have steps left to try out.

FINAL_ANSWER: your answer

Otherwise, return the next FUNCTION_CALL."

üéØ Your Tasks:
- Identify the INTENT of the user's query.
- Extract important ENTITIES (e.g., company names, numbers, concepts).
- Suggest a TOOL_HINT if you can guess a useful tool (optional).
- Pick the most relevant MCP server IDs from the catalog above.
- Suggest queries that can be looked up in the cached memory which can help perform the task better, this can be used for the following:
  1. Add additonal information which is not already present in the current query, but may be present in cached memory
  2. Similar queries which have already been solved might have some parts of the answer or the complete answer which might be helpful
  3. Any additional information which might be needed

üìã Your Output Format (in JSON):

‚úÖ Rules:
- selected_servers must match server IDs exactly (e.g., server1, server2).
- If none are a clear match, select all servers.
- Keep output short and clean.
- Maintain session_memory_snapshot to capture what has been done so far and what was the outcome of the steps
- Maintain useful_results to capture all the useful information obtained so far which can help solve the user query
- Never overwrite previous session_memory_snapshot or previous useful_results, always append to it.
- If you have valid answers from tool calls, they are success

‚è≥ Steps & Lifelines
- You have a total of 3 steps to solve the user query
- You are currently at step number 2
- You have currently 3 lifelines left in the current step

üìã Perception Inputs: intent='Find the price Anmol Singh paid for a DLF apartment through Capbridge.' entities=['Anmol Singh', 'DLF apartment', 'Capbridge', 'price'] tool_hint='websearch' tags=[] selected_servers=['websearch'] memory_lookup_queries=['Previous transactions involving Anmol Singh and DLF', 'Capbridge Ventures investment history']

Inside the solve() function, you can choose ONLY ONE of the following patterns, but cannot mix patterns in a single solve() implementation:
1. Sequential dependency: Chain tool outputs until final result, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"
2. Independent sequential: Merge results in final answer, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: Wikipedia says {tool_result_a}. News says {tool_result_b}"
3. Fetch information chunk: Obtain information chunks using tools, NEVER parse or prcocess further if similar attempts failed, ALWAYS return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
4. Session memory summary: Use session memory and stored content to return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {summarized_content}" If your final answer is from cache data then add the following line to the final answer - "[NOTE: This answer was obtained from cached results due to tool error encountered during execution]"

‚ùóLook for sandbox errors or tool execution errors in "Session Memory", if you had ERRORS AND if you have just "1" lifeline left in the "current step":
1. You have access to function "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" which obtains the result of the specified tool_name from cache memory, and this works best for fetching content or informtion chunks either from web or documents  
2. Ignore the above patterns completely, and fetch the tool result from cached memory using the following code "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" and return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {cached_result}.

NOTE: Session Memory is the current working memory, and Cache Memory is an alternate source to fetch tool outputs if sandbox or tool execution fails.


‚úÖ Sample Format for solve(): 
```python
import json
async def solve():
    # PLAN:
    """ 
    <Add a descriptive plan here which describes the logic for solve(), and includes the pattern#, steps involved and reasoning, error handling and fallback options. You must include how you are relying on cached result when running out of lifelines>

    """
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Convert characters to ASCII values. Usage: input={"input": {"string": "INDIA"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"string": "INDIA"}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)
    numbers = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FUNCTION_CALL: 2
    """Sum exponentials of int list. Usage: input={"input": {"numbers": [65, 66, 67]}} result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)"""

    result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)
    final_result = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FINAL_RESULT
    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"

```

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Validate PLAN against rules.
- Follow exact Usage docstring format for tool calls.
- Use only available tools from Tool Catalog.
- Call tools by name (await mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)).
- Precede calls with full docstring ("""docstring""").
- Use function signature (tool(input)).
- Parse dependent results (parsed = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]). (NEVER use ["results"], ALWAYS USE ["result"])
- Never inline json.loads(...) in f-strings; assign to variable first.
- NEVER parse document/webpage chunks to look for FINAL_ANSWER OR chain more tools based on result, always return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
- NEVER use "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" & "mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)" in the same solve() function
- NEVER return document/webpage chunks OR FAILURE/ERROR Messages in FINAL_ANSWER.
- NEVER return FINAL_ANSWER without the user query being solved if you have steps left to try out.

üéØ Your Tasks:
- Identify the INTENT of the user's query.
- Extract important ENTITIES (e.g., company names, numbers, concepts).
- Suggest a TOOL_HINT if you can guess a useful tool (optional).
- Pick the most relevant MCP server IDs from the catalog above.
- Suggest queries that can be looked up in the cached memory which can help perform the task better, this can be used for the following:
  1. Add additonal information which is not already present in the current query, but may be present in cached memory
  2. Similar queries which have already been solved might have some parts of the answer or the complete answer which might be helpful
  3. Any additional information which might be needed

üìã Your Output Format (in JSON):

  "intent": "...",
  "entities": [...],

}

‚úÖ Rules:
- selected_servers must match server IDs exactly (e.g., server1, server2).
- If none are a clear match, select all servers.
- Keep output short and clean.
- Maintain session_memory_snapshot to capture what has been done so far and what was the outcome of the steps
- Maintain useful_results to capture all the useful information obtained so far which can help solve the user query
- Never overwrite previous session_memory_snapshot or previous useful_results, always append to it.
- If you have valid answers from tool calls, they are success

2. Check Session Memory ‚Üí What sub-tasks were already solved 
3. Evaluate lifelines ‚Üí if there were tool/sandbox execution failures or errors? How many lifelines left?
4. Evaluate number of steps ‚Üí How many steps consumed, how many left?  
3. Review Perception Inputs ‚Üí Identify suggested next tasks.

‚è≥ Steps & Lifelines
- You have a total of 3 steps to solve the user query
- You are currently at step number 2
- You have currently 2 lifelines left in the current step

üìã Perception Inputs: intent='Determine the amount Anmol Singh paid for a DLF apartment through Capbridge.' entities=['Anmol Singh', 'DLF apartment', 'Capbridge'] tool_hint="Review cached search results about Anmol Singh's DLF apartment purchase via Capbridge." tags=[] selected_servers=['documents', 'websearch'] memory_lookup_queries=['Anmol Singh DLF apartment purchase price Capbridge Ventures', 'Capbridge Ventures real estate investments']

Inside the solve() function, you can choose ONLY ONE of the following patterns, but cannot mix patterns in a single solve() implementation:
1. Sequential dependency: Chain tool outputs until final result, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"
2. Independent sequential: Merge results in final answer, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: Wikipedia says {tool_result_a}. News says {tool_result_b}"
3. Fetch information chunk: Obtain information chunks using tools, NEVER parse or prcocess further if similar attempts failed, ALWAYS return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
4. Session memory summary: Use session memory and stored content to return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {summarized_content}" If your final answer is from cache data then add the following line to the final answer - "[NOTE: This answer was obtained from cached results due to tool error encountered during execution]"

‚ùóLook for sandbox errors or tool execution errors in "Session Memory", if you had ERRORS AND if you have just "1" lifeline left in the "current step":
1. You have access to function "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" which obtains the result of the specified tool_name from cache memory, and this works best for fetching content or informtion chunks either from web or documents  
2. Ignore the above patterns completely, and fetch the tool result from cached memory using the following code "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" and return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {cached_result}.

NOTE: Session Memory is the current working memory, and Cache Memory is an alternate source to fetch tool outputs if sandbox or tool execution fails.


‚úÖ Sample Format for solve(): 
```python
import json
async def solve():
    # PLAN:
    """ 
    <Add a descriptive plan here which describes the logic for solve(), and includes the pattern#, steps involved and reasoning, error handling and fallback options. You must include how you are relying on cached result when running out of lifelines>

    """
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Convert characters to ASCII values. Usage: input={"input": {"string": "INDIA"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"string": "INDIA"}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)
    numbers = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FUNCTION_CALL: 2
    """Sum exponentials of int list. Usage: input={"input": {"numbers": [65, 66, 67]}} result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"numbers": numbers}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)
    final_result = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FINAL_RESULT
    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"

```

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Validate PLAN against rules.
- Follow exact Usage docstring format for tool calls.
- Use only available tools from Tool Catalog.
- Call tools by name (await mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)).
- Precede calls with full docstring ("""docstring""").
- Use function signature (tool(input)).
- Parse dependent results (parsed = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]). (NEVER use ["results"], ALWAYS USE ["result"])
- Never inline json.loads(...) in f-strings; assign to variable first.
- NEVER parse document/webpage chunks to look for FINAL_ANSWER OR chain more tools based on result, always return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
- NEVER use "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" & "mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)" in the same solve() function
- NEVER return document/webpage chunks OR FAILURE/ERROR Messages in FINAL_ANSWER.
- NEVER return FINAL_ANSWER without the user query being solved if you have steps left to try out.

üéØ Your Tasks:
- Identify the INTENT of the user's query.
- Extract important ENTITIES (e.g., company names, numbers, concepts).
- Suggest a TOOL_HINT if you can guess a useful tool (optional).
- Pick the most relevant MCP server IDs from the catalog above.
- Suggest queries that can be looked up in the cached memory which can help perform the task better, this can be used for the following:
  1. Add additonal information which is not already present in the current query, but may be present in cached memory
  2. Similar queries which have already been solved might have some parts of the answer or the complete answer which might be helpful
  3. Any additional information which might be needed

üìã Your Output Format (in JSON):
{
  "intent": "...",
  "entities": [...],
  "tool_hint": "...",
  "selected_servers": ["server1", "server2"]

                     "Result 2: Tesla is a publicly listed company with symbol TSLA"]
}

‚úÖ Rules:
- selected_servers must match server IDs exactly (e.g., server1, server2).
- If none are a clear match, select all servers.
- Keep output short and clean.
- Maintain session_memory_snapshot to capture what has been done so far and what was the outcome of the steps
- Maintain useful_results to capture all the useful information obtained so far which can help solve the user query
- Never overwrite previous session_memory_snapshot or previous useful_results, always append to it.
- If you have valid answers from tool calls, they are success

üéØ Goal: Return ONLY ONE async Python function `solve()` that resolves the user query in EXACTLY ONE-GO using ONLY available tools.

 
Approach:
1. Analyze Query ‚Üí Break into tool-solvable sub-tasks.
2. Check Session Memory ‚Üí What sub-tasks were already solved 
3. Evaluate lifelines ‚Üí if there were tool/sandbox execution failures or errors? How many lifelines left?
4. Evaluate number of steps ‚Üí How many steps consumed, how many left?  
3. Review Perception Inputs ‚Üí Identify suggested next tasks.
4. Define solve() ‚Üí Solve in one execution - either conclude or implement next steps

‚è≥ Steps & Lifelines
- You have a total of 3 steps to solve the user query
- You are currently at step number 2
- You have currently 1 lifelines left in the current step

üìã Perception Inputs: intent="Find the purchase price of Anmol Singh's DLF apartment bought via Capbridge." entities=['Anmol Singh', 'DLF apartment', 'Capbridge'] tool_hint='search_stored_documents' tags=[] selected_servers=['documents', 'websearch'] memory_lookup_queries=['Anmol Singh DLF apartment purchase price Capbridge Ventures', 'Capbridge Ventures real estate investments']

Inside the solve() function, you can choose ONLY ONE of the following patterns, but cannot mix patterns in a single solve() implementation:
1. Sequential dependency: Chain tool outputs until final result, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"
2. Independent sequential: Merge results in final answer, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: Wikipedia says {tool_result_a}. News says {tool_result_b}"
3. Fetch information chunk: Obtain information chunks using tools, NEVER parse or prcocess further if similar attempts failed, ALWAYS return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
4. Session memory summary: Use session memory and stored content to return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {summarized_content}" If your final answer is from cache data then add the following line to the final answer - "[NOTE: This answer was obtained from cached results due to tool error encountered during execution]"

‚ùóLook for sandbox errors or tool execution errors in "Session Memory", if you had ERRORS AND if you have just "1" lifeline left in the "current step":
1. You have access to function "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" which obtains the result of the specified tool_name from cache memory, and this works best for fetching content or informtion chunks either from web or documents  
2. Ignore the above patterns completely, and fetch the tool result from cached memory using the following code "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" and return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {cached_result}.

NOTE: Session Memory is the current working memory, and Cache Memory is an alternate source to fetch tool outputs if sandbox or tool execution fails.

üéØ Your Tasks:
- Identify the INTENT of the user's query.
- Extract important ENTITIES (e.g., company names, numbers, concepts).
- Suggest a TOOL_HINT if you can guess a useful tool (optional).
- Pick the most relevant MCP server IDs from the catalog above.
- Suggest queries that can be looked up in the cached memory which can help perform the task better, this can be used for the following:
  1. Add additonal information which is not already present in the current query, but may be present in cached memory
  2. Similar queries which have already been solved might have some parts of the answer or the complete answer which might be helpful
  3. Any additional information which might be needed

üìã Your Output Format (in JSON):
{
  "intent": "...",
  "entities": [...],
  "tool_hint": "...",
  "selected_servers": ["server1", "server2"]

}

‚úÖ Rules:
- selected_servers must match server IDs exactly (e.g., server1, server2).
- If none are a clear match, select all servers.
- Keep output short and clean.
- Maintain session_memory_snapshot to capture what has been done so far and what was the outcome of the steps
- Maintain useful_results to capture all the useful information obtained so far which can help solve the user query
- Never overwrite previous session_memory_snapshot or previous useful_results, always append to it.

üéØ Goal: Return ONLY ONE async Python function `solve()` that resolves the user query in EXACTLY ONE-GO using ONLY available tools.

 
Approach:
1. Analyze Query ‚Üí Break into tool-solvable sub-tasks.
2. Check Session Memory ‚Üí What sub-tasks were already solved 
3. Evaluate lifelines ‚Üí if there were tool/sandbox execution failures or errors? How many lifelines left?
4. Evaluate number of steps ‚Üí How many steps consumed, how many left?  
3. Review Perception Inputs ‚Üí Identify suggested next tasks.
4. Define solve() ‚Üí Solve in one execution - either conclude or implement next steps

‚è≥ Steps & Lifelines
- You have a total of 3 steps to solve the user query
- You are currently at step number 2
- You have currently 0 lifelines left in the current step

üìã Perception Inputs: intent='Determine the amount paid by Anmol Singh for a DLF apartment through Capbridge.' entities=['Anmol Singh', 'DLF apartment', 'Capbridge'] tool_hint='documents, websearch' tags=[] selected_servers=['documents', 'websearch'] memory_lookup_queries=['Anmol Singh DLF apartment Capbridge payment', 'Capbridge deals DLF', 'Anmol Singh investments']

Inside the solve() function, you can choose ONLY ONE of the following patterns, but cannot mix patterns in a single solve() implementation:
1. Sequential dependency: Chain tool outputs until final result, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"
2. Independent sequential: Merge results in final answer, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: Wikipedia says {tool_result_a}. News says {tool_result_b}"
3. Fetch information chunk: Obtain information chunks using tools, NEVER parse or prcocess further if similar attempts failed, ALWAYS return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
4. Session memory summary: Use session memory and stored content to return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {summarized_content}" If your final answer is from cache data then add the following line to the final answer - "[NOTE: This answer was obtained from cached results due to tool error encountered during execution]"

‚ùóLook for sandbox errors or tool execution errors in "Session Memory", if you had ERRORS AND if you have just "1" lifeline left in the "current step":
1. You have access to function "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" which obtains the result of the specified tool_name from cache memory, and this works best for fetching content or informtion chunks either from web or documents  
2. Ignore the above patterns completely, and fetch the tool result from cached memory using the following code "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" and return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {cached_result}.

NOTE: Session Memory is the current working memory, and Cache Memory is an alternate source to fetch tool outputs if sandbox or tool execution fails.

    # PLAN:
    """ 
    <Add a descriptive plan here which describes the logic for solve(), and includes the pattern#, steps involved and reasoning, error handling and fallback options. You must include how you are relying on cached result when running out of lifelines>

    """
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Convert characters to ASCII values. Usage: input={"input": {"string": "INDIA"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"string": "INDIA"}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)
    numbers = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    final_result = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FINAL_RESULT
    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"

```

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Validate PLAN against rules.
- Follow exact Usage docstring format for tool calls.
- Use only available tools from Tool Catalog.
- Call tools by name (await mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)).
- Precede calls with full docstring ("""docstring""").
- Use function signature (tool(input)).
- Parse dependent results (parsed = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]). (NEVER use ["results"], ALWAYS USE ["result"])
- Never inline json.loads(...) in f-strings; assign to variable first.
- NEVER parse document/webpage chunks to look for FINAL_ANSWER OR chain more tools based on result, always return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
- NEVER use "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" & "mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)" in the same solve() function
- NEVER return document/webpage chunks OR FAILURE/ERROR Messages in FINAL_ANSWER.
- NEVER return FINAL_ANSWER without the user query being solved if you have steps left to try out.

üéØ Your Tasks:
- Identify the INTENT of the user's query.
- Extract important ENTITIES (e.g., company names, numbers, concepts).
- Suggest a TOOL_HINT if you can guess a useful tool (optional).
- Pick the most relevant MCP server IDs from the catalog above.
- Suggest queries that can be looked up in the cached memory which can help perform the task better, this can be used for the following:
  1. Add additonal information which is not already present in the current query, but may be present in cached memory
  2. Similar queries which have already been solved might have some parts of the answer or the complete answer which might be helpful
  3. Any additional information which might be needed

üìã Your Output Format (in JSON):

}

‚úÖ Rules:
- selected_servers must match server IDs exactly (e.g., server1, server2).
- If none are a clear match, select all servers.
- Keep output short and clean.
- Maintain session_memory_snapshot to capture what has been done so far and what was the outcome of the steps
- Maintain useful_results to capture all the useful information obtained so far which can help solve the user query
- Never overwrite previous session_memory_snapshot or previous useful_results, always append to it.
- If you have valid answers from tool calls, they are success

‚è≥ Steps & Lifelines
- You have a total of 3 steps to solve the user query
- You are currently at step number 3
- You have currently 3 lifelines left in the current step

üìã Perception Inputs: intent='Determine the amount paid by Anmol Singh for a DLF apartment through Capbridge.' entities=['Anmol Singh', 'DLF apartment', 'Capbridge', 'payment'] tool_hint='documents' tags=[] selected_servers=['documents'] memory_lookup_queries=['Anmol Singh DLF apartment purchase Capbridge', 'Gensol promoter Anmol Singh Jaggi DLF Camellias apartment', 'Capbridge Ventures DLF transactions']

Inside the solve() function, you can choose ONLY ONE of the following patterns, but cannot mix patterns in a single solve() implementation:
1. Sequential dependency: Chain tool outputs until final result, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"
2. Independent sequential: Merge results in final answer, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: Wikipedia says {tool_result_a}. News says {tool_result_b}"
3. Fetch information chunk: Obtain information chunks using tools, NEVER parse or prcocess further if similar attempts failed, ALWAYS return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
4. Session memory summary: Use session memory and stored content to return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {summarized_content}" If your final answer is from cache data then add the following line to the final answer - "[NOTE: This answer was obtained from cached results due to tool error encountered during execution]"

‚ùóLook for sandbox errors or tool execution errors in "Session Memory", if you had ERRORS AND if you have just "1" lifeline left in the "current step":
1. You have access to function "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" which obtains the result of the specified tool_name from cache memory, and this works best for fetching content or informtion chunks either from web or documents  
2. Ignore the above patterns completely, and fetch the tool result from cached memory using the following code "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" and return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {cached_result}.

NOTE: Session Memory is the current working memory, and Cache Memory is an alternate source to fetch tool outputs if sandbox or tool execution fails.


‚úÖ Sample Format for solve(): 
```python
import json
async def solve():
    # PLAN:
    """ 
    <Add a descriptive plan here which describes the logic for solve(), and includes the pattern#, steps involved and reasoning, error handling and fallback options. You must include how you are relying on cached result when running out of lifelines>

- Parse dependent results (parsed = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]). (NEVER use ["results"], ALWAYS USE ["result"])
- Never inline json.loads(...) in f-strings; assign to variable first.
- NEVER parse document/webpage chunks to look for FINAL_ANSWER OR chain more tools based on result, always return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"

üéØ Your Tasks:
- Identify the INTENT of the user's query.
- Extract important ENTITIES (e.g., company names, numbers, concepts).
- Suggest a TOOL_HINT if you can guess a useful tool (optional).
- Pick the most relevant MCP server IDs from the catalog above.
- Suggest queries that can be looked up in the cached memory which can help perform the task better, this can be used for the following:
  1. Add additonal information which is not already present in the current query, but may be present in cached memory
  2. Similar queries which have already been solved might have some parts of the answer or the complete answer which might be helpful
  3. Any additional information which might be needed

üìã Your Output Format (in JSON):
{
  "intent": "...",
  "entities": [...],
  "tool_hint": "...",
  "selected_servers": ["server1", "server2"]
  "memory_lookup_queries": ["What information is available on God of Cricket", "What other sports are peferred by the user"]
  "session_memory_snapshot": ["Step 1, Lifelines remaining 2: Executed tools .... which was success and returned useful information on ... which was captured",
                              "Step 1, Lifelines remaining 1: Executed tools .... which returned error and no useful information could be captured"]

}

‚úÖ Rules:
- selected_servers must match server IDs exactly (e.g., server1, server2).
- If none are a clear match, select all servers.
- Keep output short and clean.
- Maintain session_memory_snapshot to capture what has been done so far and what was the outcome of the steps
- Maintain useful_results to capture all the useful information obtained so far which can help solve the user query
- Never overwrite previous session_memory_snapshot or previous useful_results, always append to it.
- If you have valid answers from tool calls, they are success

üéØ Goal: Return ONLY ONE async Python function `solve()` that resolves the user query in EXACTLY ONE-GO using ONLY available tools.

 
Approach:
1. Analyze Query ‚Üí Break into tool-solvable sub-tasks.
2. Check Session Memory ‚Üí What sub-tasks were already solved 
3. Evaluate lifelines ‚Üí if there were tool/sandbox execution failures or errors? How many lifelines left?
4. Evaluate number of steps ‚Üí How many steps consumed, how many left?  
3. Review Perception Inputs ‚Üí Identify suggested next tasks.
4. Define solve() ‚Üí Solve in one execution - either conclude or implement next steps

Inside the solve() function, you can choose ONLY ONE of the following patterns, but cannot mix patterns in a single solve() implementation:
1. Sequential dependency: Chain tool outputs until final result, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"
2. Independent sequential: Merge results in final answer, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: Wikipedia says {tool_result_a}. News says {tool_result_b}"
3. Fetch information chunk: Obtain information chunks using tools, NEVER parse or prcocess further if similar attempts failed, ALWAYS return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
4. Session memory summary: Use session memory and stored content to return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {summarized_content}" If your final answer is from cache data then add the following line to the final answer - "[NOTE: This answer was obtained from cached results due to tool error encountered during execution]"

‚ùóLook for sandbox errors or tool execution errors in "Session Memory", if you had ERRORS AND if you have just "1" lifeline left in the "current step":
1. You have access to function "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" which obtains the result of the specified tool_name from cache memory, and this works best for fetching content or informtion chunks either from web or documents  
2. Ignore the above patterns completely, and fetch the tool result from cached memory using the following code "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" and return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {cached_result}.

NOTE: Session Memory is the current working memory, and Cache Memory is an alternate source to fetch tool outputs if sandbox or tool execution fails.

    # PLAN:
    """ 
    <Add a descriptive plan here which describes the logic for solve(), and includes the pattern#, steps involved and reasoning, error handling and fallback options. You must include how you are relying on cached result when running out of lifelines>

    """
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Convert characters to ASCII values. Usage: input={"input": {"string": "INDIA"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"string": "INDIA"}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)
    numbers = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    final_result = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FINAL_RESULT
    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"

```

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Validate PLAN against rules.
- Follow exact Usage docstring format for tool calls.
- Use only available tools from Tool Catalog.
- Call tools by name (await mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)).
- Precede calls with full docstring ("""docstring""").
- Use function signature (tool(input)).
- Parse dependent results (parsed = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]). (NEVER use ["results"], ALWAYS USE ["result"])
- Never inline json.loads(...) in f-strings; assign to variable first.
- NEVER parse document/webpage chunks to look for FINAL_ANSWER OR chain more tools based on result, always return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
- NEVER use "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" & "mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)" in the same solve() function
- NEVER return document/webpage chunks OR FAILURE/ERROR Messages in FINAL_ANSWER.
- NEVER return FINAL_ANSWER without the user query being solved if you have steps left to try out.

üéØ Your Tasks:
- Identify the INTENT of the user's query.
- Extract important ENTITIES (e.g., company names, numbers, concepts).
- Suggest a TOOL_HINT if you can guess a useful tool (optional).
- Pick the most relevant MCP server IDs from the catalog above.
- Suggest queries that can be looked up in the cached memory which can help perform the task better, this can be used for the following:
  1. Add additonal information which is not already present in the current query, but may be present in cached memory
  2. Similar queries which have already been solved might have some parts of the answer or the complete answer which might be helpful
  3. Any additional information which might be needed

üìã Your Output Format (in JSON):
{
  "intent": "...",
  "entities": [...],
  "tool_hint": "...",
  "selected_servers": ["server1", "server2"]
  "memory_lookup_queries": ["What information is available on God of Cricket", "What other sports are peferred by the user"]

                     "Result 2: Tesla is a publicly listed company with symbol TSLA"]
}

‚úÖ Rules:
- selected_servers must match server IDs exactly (e.g., server1, server2).
- If none are a clear match, select all servers.
- Keep output short and clean.
- Maintain session_memory_snapshot to capture what has been done so far and what was the outcome of the steps
- Maintain useful_results to capture all the useful information obtained so far which can help solve the user query
- Never overwrite previous session_memory_snapshot or previous useful_results, always append to it.
- If you have valid answers from tool calls, they are success

üéØ Goal: Return ONLY ONE async Python function `solve()` that resolves the user query in EXACTLY ONE-GO using ONLY available tools.

 
Approach:
1. Analyze Query ‚Üí Break into tool-solvable sub-tasks.
2. Check Session Memory ‚Üí What sub-tasks were already solved 
3. Evaluate lifelines ‚Üí if there were tool/sandbox execution failures or errors? How many lifelines left?
4. Evaluate number of steps ‚Üí How many steps consumed, how many left?  
3. Review Perception Inputs ‚Üí Identify suggested next tasks.
4. Define solve() ‚Üí Solve in one execution - either conclude or implement next steps

‚è≥ Steps & Lifelines
- You have a total of 3 steps to solve the user query
- You are currently at step number 3
- You have currently 1 lifelines left in the current step

üìã Perception Inputs: intent='Determine the amount paid by Anmol Singh for a DLF apartment via Capbridge.' entities=['Anmol Singh', 'DLF apartment', 'Capbridge'] tool_hint='documents' tags=[] selected_servers=['documents'] memory_lookup_queries=['Amount Anmol Singh paid for DLF property', 'Capbridge investments in DLF apartments', 'Real estate transactions involving Anmol Singh']

Inside the solve() function, you can choose ONLY ONE of the following patterns, but cannot mix patterns in a single solve() implementation:
1. Sequential dependency: Chain tool outputs until final result, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"
2. Independent sequential: Merge results in final answer, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: Wikipedia says {tool_result_a}. News says {tool_result_b}"
3. Fetch information chunk: Obtain information chunks using tools, NEVER parse or prcocess further if similar attempts failed, ALWAYS return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
4. Session memory summary: Use session memory and stored content to return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {summarized_content}" If your final answer is from cache data then add the following line to the final answer - "[NOTE: This answer was obtained from cached results due to tool error encountered during execution]"

‚ùóLook for sandbox errors or tool execution errors in "Session Memory", if you had ERRORS AND if you have just "1" lifeline left in the "current step":
1. You have access to function "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" which obtains the result of the specified tool_name from cache memory, and this works best for fetching content or informtion chunks either from web or documents  
2. Ignore the above patterns completely, and fetch the tool result from cached memory using the following code "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" and return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {cached_result}.

NOTE: Session Memory is the current working memory, and Cache Memory is an alternate source to fetch tool outputs if sandbox or tool execution fails.


‚úÖ Sample Format for solve(): 
```python
import json
async def solve():
    # PLAN:
    """ 
    <Add a descriptive plan here which describes the logic for solve(), and includes the pattern#, steps involved and reasoning, error handling and fallback options. You must include how you are relying on cached result when running out of lifelines>

    """
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Convert characters to ASCII values. Usage: input={"input": {"string": "INDIA"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"string": "INDIA"}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)
    numbers = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FUNCTION_CALL: 2
    """Sum exponentials of int list. Usage: input={"input": {"numbers": [65, 66, 67]}} result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"numbers": numbers}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)
    final_result = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FINAL_RESULT
    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"

```

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Validate PLAN against rules.
- Follow exact Usage docstring format for tool calls.
- Use only available tools from Tool Catalog.
- Call tools by name (await mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)).
- Precede calls with full docstring ("""docstring""").
- Use function signature (tool(input)).
- Parse dependent results (parsed = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]). (NEVER use ["results"], ALWAYS USE ["result"])
- Never inline json.loads(...) in f-strings; assign to variable first.
- NEVER parse document/webpage chunks to look for FINAL_ANSWER OR chain more tools based on result, always return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
- NEVER use "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" & "mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)" in the same solve() function
- NEVER return document/webpage chunks OR FAILURE/ERROR Messages in FINAL_ANSWER.
- NEVER return FINAL_ANSWER without the user query being solved if you have steps left to try out.

üéØ Your Tasks:
- Identify the INTENT of the user's query.
- Extract important ENTITIES (e.g., company names, numbers, concepts).
- Suggest a TOOL_HINT if you can guess a useful tool (optional).
- Pick the most relevant MCP server IDs from the catalog above.
- Suggest queries that can be looked up in the cached memory which can help perform the task better, this can be used for the following:
  1. Add additonal information which is not already present in the current query, but may be present in cached memory
  2. Similar queries which have already been solved might have some parts of the answer or the complete answer which might be helpful
  3. Any additional information which might be needed

üìã Your Output Format (in JSON):

‚úÖ Rules:
- selected_servers must match server IDs exactly (e.g., server1, server2).
- If none are a clear match, select all servers.
- Keep output short and clean.
- Maintain session_memory_snapshot to capture what has been done so far and what was the outcome of the steps
- Maintain useful_results to capture all the useful information obtained so far which can help solve the user query
- Never overwrite previous session_memory_snapshot or previous useful_results, always append to it.

üéØ Goal: Return ONLY ONE async Python function `solve()` that resolves the user query in EXACTLY ONE-GO using ONLY available tools.

 
Approach:
1. Analyze Query ‚Üí Break into tool-solvable sub-tasks.
2. Check Session Memory ‚Üí What sub-tasks were already solved 
3. Evaluate lifelines ‚Üí if there were tool/sandbox execution failures or errors? How many lifelines left?
4. Evaluate number of steps ‚Üí How many steps consumed, how many left?  
3. Review Perception Inputs ‚Üí Identify suggested next tasks.
4. Define solve() ‚Üí Solve in one execution - either conclude or implement next steps

‚è≥ Steps & Lifelines
- You have a total of 3 steps to solve the user query
- You are currently at step number 3
- You have currently 0 lifelines left in the current step

üìã Perception Inputs: intent='Determine the amount Anmol Singh paid for a DLF apartment via Capbridge.' entities=['Anmol Singh', 'DLF apartment', 'Capbridge', 'amount'] tool_hint='documents' tags=[] selected_servers=['documents', 'websearch'] memory_lookup_queries=['Anmol Singh DLF apartment purchase details', 'Capbridge investments in DLF apartments', 'Real estate transactions involving Anmol Singh']

Inside the solve() function, you can choose ONLY ONE of the following patterns, but cannot mix patterns in a single solve() implementation:
1. Sequential dependency: Chain tool outputs until final result, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"
2. Independent sequential: Merge results in final answer, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: Wikipedia says {tool_result_a}. News says {tool_result_b}"
3. Fetch information chunk: Obtain information chunks using tools, NEVER parse or prcocess further if similar attempts failed, ALWAYS return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
4. Session memory summary: Use session memory and stored content to return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {summarized_content}" If your final answer is from cache data then add the following line to the final answer - "[NOTE: This answer was obtained from cached results due to tool error encountered during execution]"

‚ùóLook for sandbox errors or tool execution errors in "Session Memory", if you had ERRORS AND if you have just "1" lifeline left in the "current step":
1. You have access to function "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" which obtains the result of the specified tool_name from cache memory, and this works best for fetching content or informtion chunks either from web or documents  
2. Ignore the above patterns completely, and fetch the tool result from cached memory using the following code "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" and return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {cached_result}.

NOTE: Session Memory is the current working memory, and Cache Memory is an alternate source to fetch tool outputs if sandbox or tool execution fails.


‚úÖ Sample Format for solve(): 
```python
import json
async def solve():
    # PLAN:
    """ 
    <Add a descriptive plan here which describes the logic for solve(), and includes the pattern#, steps involved and reasoning, error handling and fallback options. You must include how you are relying on cached result when running out of lifelines>

    """
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Convert characters to ASCII values. Usage: input={"input": {"string": "INDIA"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"string": "INDIA"}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)
    numbers = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FUNCTION_CALL: 2
    """Sum exponentials of int list. Usage: input={"input": {"numbers": [65, 66, 67]}} result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"numbers": numbers}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)
    final_result = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FINAL_RESULT
    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"

```

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Validate PLAN against rules.
- Follow exact Usage docstring format for tool calls.
- Use only available tools from Tool Catalog.
- Call tools by name (await mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)).
- Precede calls with full docstring ("""docstring""").
- Use function signature (tool(input)).
- Parse dependent results (parsed = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]). (NEVER use ["results"], ALWAYS USE ["result"])
- Never inline json.loads(...) in f-strings; assign to variable first.
- NEVER parse document/webpage chunks to look for FINAL_ANSWER OR chain more tools based on result, always return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
- NEVER use "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" & "mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)" in the same solve() function
- NEVER return document/webpage chunks OR FAILURE/ERROR Messages in FINAL_ANSWER.
- NEVER return FINAL_ANSWER without the user query being solved if you have steps left to try out.
