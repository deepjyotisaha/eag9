There are also striking synergies between his various ventures. Tesla Motors is reinforced by such infrastructure projects as SolarCity [6] and the Gigafactory. [7] Traditionally, Tesla Motors had professed to take a strict approach to the protection of intellectual property. In 2012, the company observed: ‚ÄòOur business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.‚Äô [8] Tesla Motors warned: Any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing our vehicles.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: ‚ÄòOur roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 ----- ## software engineering‚Äô. [3] The company observes: ‚ÄòWe believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.‚Äô [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors‚Äô biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X.\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='with regard to patents.‚Äô [61] She observed: ‚ÄòA lot of companies in the high tech space are dismayed with how the system is shaping up, so they‚Äôre trying to come up with creative ways to navigating around that system and get back to the business of innovating and creating.‚Äô [62] The announcement of Tesla Motors may help provide impetus for President Barack Obama‚Äôs efforts to address the problem of patent trolls and reduce patent litigation. Some members of the intellectual property profession have defended the legitimacy of the patent regime in light of Elon Musk‚Äôs comments. Philip Totaro provided a thoughtful riposte. [63] He observed: ‚ÄòWhile this is a noble and well-intentioned move, unfortunately, this thought process represents a widely held misconception about intellectual property: that it is only a legal matter, rather than a commercial one.‚Äô [64] Totaro responded: Patents are not just about hitting the ‚Äòlitigation lottery‚Äô as Mr. Musk put it. Patents are the codification of innovation and they represent the investment of time and effort from the innovative and creative people who have their names on them. Making the investment in intellectual property protection in the first place presumes that you are willing and able to enforce your rights. In any market there will be 61 Julie Samuels quoted in Klint Finley, ‚ÄòWith Patent Giveaway, Tesla shows Silicon Valley What Ingenuity Means‚Äô, *Wired*, 13 June 2014, http://www.wired.com/2014/06/tesla - patents/?mbid = social _ twitter 62 Ibid. 63 Philip Totaro, ‚ÄòIn Defense of IPR: The Timing of the Tesla Move will Diminish the Company‚Äôs Value‚Äô, *Green Patent Blog,* 19 June 2014, http://www.greenpatentblog.com/2014/06/19/in - defense - of - ipr - the timing - of - the - tesla - move - will - diminish - the - company%e2%80%99s - value/ 64 Ibid. 19 ----- those who are driven by greed, and we have seen the exploitation of intellectual property by so-called ‚Äúpatent trolls.‚Äù [65] ## Totaro maintained that one should not be cynical about the intellectual property regime. He wondered whether the move would undercut the value of Tesla Motors. Totaro argued that Musk could do more if he was truly committed to an open source model: ‚ÄòIf Mr. Musk would be willing to redistribute his wealth to the employees and investors who made the commitment to create value for the company in the first place, then this move to open source their patents during the formative stages of the EV industry might make more sense.‚Äô [66] It should also be noted that Tesla Motors has not abandoned its intellectual property entirely. he company has only offered access for ‚Äògood faith‚Äô uses of its patents ‚Äî which still leaves open the prospect of the company taking action against ‚Äòbad faith‚Äô uses of its patents. Professor Orly Lobel from the University of San Diego commented: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a lot of thinking in the research these days on the gap between the codified knowledge that is patentable and gets disclosed versus tacit knowledge that really exists in how you actually produce‚Äô. [67] She noted: ‚ÄòThat gap is probably relevant in this market.‚Äô [68] Her\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_9]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='to our way of life.‚Äô [85] The pair concluded: ‚ÄòWe need to take the sum of mankind‚Äôs knowledge about sustainable technologies and industries, and share it for the sake of the planet and the future generations that will inhabit it.‚Äô [86] Similarly, the futurist Jeremy Rifkin considers the rise of collaborative commons in his recent book, The Zero Marginal Cost Society. [87] He has observed that ‚Äòa powerful new technology revolution is emerging that is going to fundamentally alter our economic life.‚Äô [88] Rifkin predicts: ‚ÄòThe plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy ‚Äî part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons ‚Äî with far reaching implications for society.‚Äô [89] Rifkin envisages: ‚ÄòMillions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to 83 Don Tapscott, and Anthony Williams, *MacroWikinomics: New Solutions for a Connected Planet*, London: Atlantic Books, 2010. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Jeremy Rifkin, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of things, The Collaborative Commons,* *and the Eclipse of Capitalism*, New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2014. 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid. 24 ----- ## the global Collaborative Commons.‚Äô [90] He observes: ‚ÄòProsumers are plugging into the fledgling Internet of Things (IoT) and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost.‚Äô [91] Rifkin‚Äôs thesis is that monopoly capitalism will be displayed by a collaborative commons. [92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: ‚ÄòIf ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.‚Äô [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

The announcement by Tesla Motors also promoted a wider discussion about economics, business, and innovation in respect of the automobile industry. Professor Joshua Gans, an economist from the University of Toronto, commented, ‚ÄòIt is 448 words that I believe (despite its length) may well become the Gettysburg Address for entrepreneurship and innovation.‚Äô [94] In his address, Elon Musk emphasized: ‚ÄòTechnology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world‚Äôs most 94 Joshua Gans, ‚ÄòIntellectual Property Strategy as Public Relations‚Äô, Digitopoly, 12 June 2014, http://www.digitopoly.org/2014/06/12/intellectual -\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_12]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='used for transportation and grid storage. Electric vehicles can be charged at work and become a source as well as a user of energy for the home. The result will be a swift transition from liquid-energy transportation to electric transportation. [109] ## Seba admits that ‚Äòan electric vehicle is still more expensive to purchase upfront, mainly due to battery costs‚Äô. [110] He predicts that ‚Äòlike other technology products, the technology cost curve of electric vehicles points to a disruption soon; innovative business models will only accelerate the transition from gasoline to electric vehicles.‚Äô [111] It is certainly notable that Elon Musk has investments in both electric cars and solar energy.

A BMW spokesman said: ‚ÄòBoth companies are strongly committed to the success of electro-mobility and discussed how to further strengthen the development of electro-mobility on an international level.‚Äô [113] There has been speculation about the development of a long-term deal between the two companies. [114] Writing in Slate, Will Oremus considered the announcement of Tesla Motors from a business perspective. He recognised: ‚ÄòThis might seem like a rash move for a company that still faces big hurdles on its path to long-term, mainstream success.‚Äô [115] Oremus anticipated a polarised 112 Associated Press, ‚ÄòTesla Hands Over the Keys to its Electric Car Technology‚Äô, *The Guardian*, 14 June 2014, http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/13/tesla - elon - musk - electric - cars - patent technology?CMP = twt _ gu 113 Edward Taylor, ‚ÄòBMW and Tesla Executives Meet to Discuss Electric Cars‚Äô, *Business Insider*, Reuters, 13 June 2014, http://www.businessinsider.com/r - bmw - and - tesla - executives - meet - to - discuss - electric - cars - 2014 13?IR = T 114 Neil Winton, ‚ÄòTesla Giveaway Spurs Speculation of Possible Deal with BMW‚Äô, *Forbes*, 13 June 2014, http://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2014/06/13/tesla - patent - giveaway - spurs - speculation - of - possible - deal with - bmw/ 115 Will Oremus, ‚ÄòTesla is Opening Its Patents to All.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: ‚ÄòOur roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 ----- ## software engineering‚Äô. [3] The company observes: ‚ÄòWe believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.‚Äô [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors‚Äô biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X.\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='with regard to patents.‚Äô [61] She observed: ‚ÄòA lot of companies in the high tech space are dismayed with how the system is shaping up, so they‚Äôre trying to come up with creative ways to navigating around that system and get back to the business of innovating and creating.‚Äô [62] The announcement of Tesla Motors may help provide impetus for President Barack Obama‚Äôs efforts to address the problem of patent trolls and reduce patent litigation. Some members of the intellectual property profession have defended the legitimacy of the patent regime in light of Elon Musk‚Äôs comments. Philip Totaro provided a thoughtful riposte. [63] He observed: ‚ÄòWhile this is a noble and well-intentioned move, unfortunately, this thought process represents a widely held misconception about intellectual property: that it is only a legal matter, rather than a commercial one.‚Äô [64] Totaro responded: Patents are not just about hitting the ‚Äòlitigation lottery‚Äô as Mr. Musk put it. Patents are the codification of innovation and they represent the investment of time and effort from the innovative and creative people who have their names on them. Making the investment in intellectual property protection in the first place presumes that you are willing and able to enforce your rights. In any market there will be 61 Julie Samuels quoted in Klint Finley, ‚ÄòWith Patent Giveaway, Tesla shows Silicon Valley What Ingenuity Means‚Äô, *Wired*, 13 June 2014, http://www.wired.com/2014/06/tesla - patents/?mbid = social _ twitter 62 Ibid. 63 Philip Totaro, ‚ÄòIn Defense of IPR: The Timing of the Tesla Move will Diminish the Company‚Äôs Value‚Äô, *Green Patent Blog,* 19 June 2014, http://www.greenpatentblog.com/2014/06/19/in - defense - of - ipr - the timing - of - the - tesla - move - will - diminish - the - company%e2%80%99s - value/ 64 Ibid. 19 ----- those who are driven by greed, and we have seen the exploitation of intellectual property by so-called ‚Äúpatent trolls.‚Äù [65] ## Totaro maintained that one should not be cynical about the intellectual property regime. He wondered whether the move would undercut the value of Tesla Motors. Totaro argued that Musk could do more if he was truly committed to an open source model: ‚ÄòIf Mr. Musk would be willing to redistribute his wealth to the employees and investors who made the commitment to create value for the company in the first place, then this move to open source their patents during the formative stages of the EV industry might make more sense.‚Äô [66] It should also be noted that Tesla Motors has not abandoned its intellectual property entirely. he company has only offered access for ‚Äògood faith‚Äô uses of its patents ‚Äî which still leaves open the prospect of the company taking action against ‚Äòbad faith‚Äô uses of its patents. Professor Orly Lobel from the University of San Diego commented: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a lot of thinking in the research these days on the gap between the codified knowledge that is patentable and gets disclosed versus tacit knowledge that really exists in how you actually produce‚Äô. [67] She noted: ‚ÄòThat gap is probably relevant in this market.‚Äô [68] Her\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_9]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='to our way of life.‚Äô [85] The pair concluded: ‚ÄòWe need to take the sum of mankind‚Äôs knowledge about sustainable technologies and industries, and share it for the sake of the planet and the future generations that will inhabit it.‚Äô [86] Similarly, the futurist Jeremy Rifkin considers the rise of collaborative commons in his recent book, The Zero Marginal Cost Society. [87] He has observed that ‚Äòa powerful new technology revolution is emerging that is going to fundamentally alter our economic life.‚Äô [88] Rifkin predicts: ‚ÄòThe plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy ‚Äî part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons ‚Äî with far reaching implications for society.‚Äô [89] Rifkin envisages: ‚ÄòMillions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to 83 Don Tapscott, and Anthony Williams, *MacroWikinomics: New Solutions for a Connected Planet*, London: Atlantic Books, 2010. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Jeremy Rifkin, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of things, The Collaborative Commons,* *and the Eclipse of Capitalism*, New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2014. 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid. 24 ----- ## the global Collaborative Commons.‚Äô [90] He observes: ‚ÄòProsumers are plugging into the fledgling Internet of Things (IoT) and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost.‚Äô [91] Rifkin‚Äôs thesis is that monopoly capitalism will be displayed by a collaborative commons. [92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: ‚ÄòIf ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.‚Äô [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: ‚ÄòOur roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 ----- ## software engineering‚Äô. [3] The company observes: ‚ÄòWe believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.‚Äô [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors‚Äô biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X.\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='with regard to patents.‚Äô [61] She observed: ‚ÄòA lot of companies in the high tech space are dismayed with how the system is shaping up, so they‚Äôre trying to come up with creative ways to navigating around that system and get back to the business of innovating and creating.‚Äô [62] The announcement of Tesla Motors may help provide impetus for President Barack Obama‚Äôs efforts to address the problem of patent trolls and reduce patent litigation. Some members of the intellectual property profession have defended the legitimacy of the patent regime in light of Elon Musk‚Äôs comments. Philip Totaro provided a thoughtful riposte. [63] He observed: ‚ÄòWhile this is a noble and well-intentioned move, unfortunately, this thought process represents a widely held misconception about intellectual property: that it is only a legal matter, rather than a commercial one.‚Äô [64] Totaro responded: Patents are not just about hitting the ‚Äòlitigation lottery‚Äô as Mr. Musk put it. Patents are the codification of innovation and they represent the investment of time and effort from the innovative and creative people who have their names on them. Making the investment in intellectual property protection in the first place presumes that you are willing and able to enforce your rights. In any market there will be 61 Julie Samuels quoted in Klint Finley, ‚ÄòWith Patent Giveaway, Tesla shows Silicon Valley What Ingenuity Means‚Äô, *Wired*, 13 June 2014, http://www.wired.com/2014/06/tesla - patents/?mbid = social _ twitter 62 Ibid. 63 Philip Totaro, ‚ÄòIn Defense of IPR: The Timing of the Tesla Move will Diminish the Company‚Äôs Value‚Äô, *Green Patent Blog,* 19 June 2014, http://www.greenpatentblog.com/2014/06/19/in - defense - of - ipr - the timing - of - the - tesla - move - will - diminish - the - company%e2%80%99s - value/ 64 Ibid. 19 ----- those who are driven by greed, and we have seen the exploitation of intellectual property by so-called ‚Äúpatent trolls.‚Äù [65] ## Totaro maintained that one should not be cynical about the intellectual property regime. He wondered whether the move would undercut the value of Tesla Motors. Totaro argued that Musk could do more if he was truly committed to an open source model: ‚ÄòIf Mr. Musk would be willing to redistribute his wealth to the employees and investors who made the commitment to create value for the company in the first place, then this move to open source their patents during the formative stages of the EV industry might make more sense.‚Äô [66] It should also be noted that Tesla Motors has not abandoned its intellectual property entirely. he company has only offered access for ‚Äògood faith‚Äô uses of its patents ‚Äî which still leaves open the prospect of the company taking action against ‚Äòbad faith‚Äô uses of its patents. Professor Orly Lobel from the University of San Diego commented: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a lot of thinking in the research these days on the gap between the codified knowledge that is patentable and gets disclosed versus tacit knowledge that really exists in how you actually produce‚Äô. [67] She noted: ‚ÄòThat gap is probably relevant in this market.‚Äô [68] Her\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_9]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='to our way of life.‚Äô [85] The pair concluded: ‚ÄòWe need to take the sum of mankind‚Äôs knowledge about sustainable technologies and industries, and share it for the sake of the planet and the future generations that will inhabit it.‚Äô [86] Similarly, the futurist Jeremy Rifkin considers the rise of collaborative commons in his recent book, The Zero Marginal Cost Society. [87] He has observed that ‚Äòa powerful new technology revolution is emerging that is going to fundamentally alter our economic life.‚Äô [88] Rifkin predicts: ‚ÄòThe plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy ‚Äî part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons ‚Äî with far reaching implications for society.‚Äô [89] Rifkin envisages: ‚ÄòMillions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to 83 Don Tapscott, and Anthony Williams, *MacroWikinomics: New Solutions for a Connected Planet*, London: Atlantic Books, 2010. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Jeremy Rifkin, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of things, The Collaborative Commons,* *and the Eclipse of Capitalism*, New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2014. 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid. 24 ----- ## the global Collaborative Commons.‚Äô [90] He observes: ‚ÄòProsumers are plugging into the fledgling Internet of Things (IoT) and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost.‚Äô [91] Rifkin‚Äôs thesis is that monopoly capitalism will be displayed by a collaborative commons. [92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: ‚ÄòIf ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.‚Äô [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

Professor Joshua Gans, an economist from the University of Toronto, commented, ‚ÄòIt is 448 words that I believe (despite its length) may well become the Gettysburg Address for entrepreneurship and innovation.‚Äô [94] In his address, Elon Musk emphasized: ‚ÄòTechnology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world‚Äôs most 94 Joshua Gans, ‚ÄòIntellectual Property Strategy as Public Relations‚Äô, Digitopoly, 12 June 2014, http://www.digitopoly.org/2014/06/12/intellectual -\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_12]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='used for transportation and grid storage.

In 2012, the company observed: ‚ÄòOur business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.‚Äô [8] Tesla Motors warned: Any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing our vehicles.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: ‚ÄòOur roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 ----- ## software engineering‚Äô. [3] The company observes: ‚ÄòWe believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.‚Äô [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: ‚ÄòOur roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 ----- ## software engineering‚Äô. [3] The company observes: ‚ÄòWe believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.‚Äô [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors‚Äô biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X.\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0]\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\'text\', text=\'with regard to patents.‚Äô [61] She observed: ‚ÄòA lot of companies in the high tech space are dismayed with how the system is shaping up, so they‚Äôre trying to come up with creative ways to navigating around that system and get back to the business of innovating and creating.‚Äô [62] The announcement of Tesla Motors may help provide impetus for President Barack Obama‚Äôs efforts to address the problem of patent trolls and reduce patent litigation. Some members of the intellectual property profession have defended the legitimacy of the patent regime in light of Elon Musk‚Äôs comments. Philip Totaro provided a thoughtful riposte. [63] He observed: ‚ÄòWhile this is a noble and well-intentioned move, unfortunately, this thought process represents a widely held misconception about intellectual property: that it is only a legal matter, rather than a commercial one.‚Äô [64] Totaro responded: Patents are not just about hitting the ‚Äòlitigation lottery‚Äô as Mr. Musk put it. Patents are the codification of innovation and they represent the investment of time and effort from the innovative and creative people who have their names on them. Making the investment in intellectual property protection in the first place presumes that you are willing and able to enforce your rights. In any market there will be 61 Julie Samuels quoted in Klint Finley, ‚ÄòWith Patent Giveaway, Tesla shows Silicon Valley What Ingenuity Means‚Äô, *Wired*, 13 June 2014, http://www.wired.com/2014/06/tesla - patents/?mbid = social _ twitter 62 Ibid. 63 Philip Totaro, ‚ÄòIn Defense of IPR: The Timing of the Tesla Move will Diminish the Company‚Äôs Value‚Äô, *Green Patent Blog,* 19 June 2014, http://www.greenpatentblog.com/2014/06/19/in - defense - of - ipr - the timing - of - the - tesla - move - will - diminish - the - company%e2%80%99s - value/ 64 Ibid. 19 ----- those who are driven by greed, and we have seen the exploitation of intellectual property by so-called ‚Äúpatent trolls.‚Äù [65] ## Totaro maintained that one should not be cynical about the intellectual property regime. He wondered whether the move would undercut the value of Tesla Motors. Totaro argued that Musk could do more if he was truly committed to an open source model: ‚ÄòIf Mr. Musk would be willing to redistribute his wealth to the employees and investors who made the commitment to create value for the company in the first place, then this move to open source their patents during the formative stages of the EV industry might make more sense.‚Äô [66] It should also be noted that Tesla Motors has not abandoned its intellectual property entirely. he company has only offered access for ‚Äògood faith‚Äô uses of its patents ‚Äî which still leaves open the prospect of the company taking action against ‚Äòbad faith‚Äô uses of its patents. Professor Orly Lobel from the University of San Diego commented: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a lot of thinking in the research these days on the gap between the codified knowledge that is patentable and gets disclosed versus tacit knowledge that really exists in how you actually produce‚Äô. [67] She noted: ‚ÄòThat gap is probably relevant in this market.‚Äô [68] Her\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_9]\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\'text\', text=\'to our way of life.‚Äô [85] The pair concluded: ‚ÄòWe need to take the sum of mankind‚Äôs knowledge about sustainable technologies and industries, and share it for the sake of the planet and the future generations that will inhabit it.‚Äô [86] Similarly, the futurist Jeremy Rifkin considers the rise of collaborative commons in his recent book, The Zero Marginal Cost Society. [87] He has observed that ‚Äòa powerful new technology revolution is emerging that is going to fundamentally alter our economic life.‚Äô [88] Rifkin predicts: ‚ÄòThe plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy ‚Äî part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons ‚Äî with far reaching implications for society.‚Äô [89] Rifkin envisages: ‚ÄòMillions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to 83 Don Tapscott, and Anthony Williams, *MacroWikinomics: New Solutions for a Connected Planet*, London: Atlantic Books, 2010. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Jeremy Rifkin, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of things, The Collaborative Commons,* *and the Eclipse of Capitalism*, New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2014. 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid. 24 ----- ## the global Collaborative Commons.‚Äô [90] He observes: ‚ÄòProsumers are plugging into the fledgling Internet of Things (IoT) and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost.‚Äô [91] Rifkin‚Äôs thesis is that monopoly capitalism will be displayed by a collaborative commons. [92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: ‚ÄòIf ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.‚Äô [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

Some members of the intellectual property profession have defended the legitimacy of the patent regime in light of Elon Musk‚Äôs comments. Philip Totaro provided a thoughtful riposte. [63] He observed: ‚ÄòWhile this is a noble and well-intentioned move, unfortunately, this thought process represents a widely held misconception about intellectual property: that it is only a legal matter, rather than a commercial one.‚Äô [64] Totaro responded: Patents are not just about hitting the ‚Äòlitigation lottery‚Äô as Mr. Musk put it. Patents are the codification of innovation and they represent the investment of time and effort from the innovative and creative people who have their names on them. Making the investment in intellectual property protection in the first place presumes that you are willing and able to enforce your rights.

He wondered whether the move would undercut the value of Tesla Motors. Totaro argued that Musk could do more if he was truly committed to an open source model: ‚ÄòIf Mr. Musk would be willing to redistribute his wealth to the employees and investors who made the commitment to create value for the company in the first place, then this move to open source their patents during the formative stages of the EV industry might make more sense.‚Äô [66] It should also be noted that Tesla Motors has not abandoned its intellectual property entirely. he company has only offered access for ‚Äògood faith‚Äô uses of its patents ‚Äî which still leaves open the prospect of the company taking action against ‚Äòbad faith‚Äô uses of its patents. Professor Orly Lobel from the University of San Diego commented: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a lot of thinking in the research these days on the gap between the codified knowledge that is patentable and gets disclosed versus tacit knowledge that really exists in how you actually produce‚Äô. [67] She noted: ‚ÄòThat gap is probably relevant in this market.‚Äô [68] Her\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_9]\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\'text\', text=\'to our way of life.‚Äô [85] The pair concluded: ‚ÄòWe need to take the sum of mankind‚Äôs knowledge about sustainable technologies and industries, and share it for the sake of the planet and the future generations that will inhabit it.‚Äô [86] Similarly, the futurist Jeremy Rifkin considers the rise of collaborative commons in his recent book, The Zero Marginal Cost Society. [87] He has observed that ‚Äòa powerful new technology revolution is emerging that is going to fundamentally alter our economic life.‚Äô [88] Rifkin predicts: ‚ÄòThe plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy ‚Äî part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons ‚Äî with far reaching implications for society.‚Äô [89] Rifkin envisages: ‚ÄòMillions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to 83 Don Tapscott, and Anthony Williams, *MacroWikinomics: New Solutions for a Connected Planet*, London: Atlantic Books, 2010. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Jeremy Rifkin, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of things, The Collaborative Commons,* *and the Eclipse of Capitalism*, New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2014. 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid. 24 ----- ## the global Collaborative Commons.‚Äô [90] He observes: ‚ÄòProsumers are plugging into the fledgling Internet of Things (IoT) and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost.‚Äô [91] Rifkin‚Äôs thesis is that monopoly capitalism will be displayed by a collaborative commons. [92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: ‚ÄòIf ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.‚Äô [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

[7] Traditionally, Tesla Motors had professed to take a strict approach to the protection of intellectual property. In 2012, the company observed: ‚ÄòOur business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.‚Äô [8] Tesla Motors warned: Any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing our vehicles.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: ‚ÄòOur roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 ----- ## software engineering‚Äô. [3] The company observes: ‚ÄòWe believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.‚Äô [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors‚Äô biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X.\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0]\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\'text\', text=\'with regard to patents.‚Äô [61] She observed: ‚ÄòA lot of companies in the high tech space are dismayed with how the system is shaping up, so they‚Äôre trying to come up with creative ways to navigating around that system and get back to the business of innovating and creating.‚Äô [62] The announcement of Tesla Motors may help provide impetus for President Barack Obama‚Äôs efforts to address the problem of patent trolls and reduce patent litigation. Some members of the intellectual property profession have defended the legitimacy of the patent regime in light of Elon Musk‚Äôs comments. Philip Totaro provided a thoughtful riposte. [63] He observed: ‚ÄòWhile this is a noble and well-intentioned move, unfortunately, this thought process represents a widely held misconception about intellectual property: that it is only a legal matter, rather than a commercial one.‚Äô [64] Totaro responded: Patents are not just about hitting the ‚Äòlitigation lottery‚Äô as Mr. Musk put it. Patents are the codification of innovation and they represent the investment of time and effort from the innovative and creative people who have their names on them. Making the investment in intellectual property protection in the first place presumes that you are willing and able to enforce your rights. In any market there will be 61 Julie Samuels quoted in Klint Finley, ‚ÄòWith Patent Giveaway, Tesla shows Silicon Valley What Ingenuity Means‚Äô, *Wired*, 13 June 2014, http://www.wired.com/2014/06/tesla - patents/?mbid = social _ twitter 62 Ibid. 63 Philip Totaro, ‚ÄòIn Defense of IPR: The Timing of the Tesla Move will Diminish the Company‚Äôs Value‚Äô, *Green Patent Blog,* 19 June 2014, http://www.greenpatentblog.com/2014/06/19/in - defense - of - ipr - the timing - of - the - tesla - move - will - diminish - the - company%e2%80%99s - value/ 64 Ibid. 19 ----- those who are driven by greed, and we have seen the exploitation of intellectual property by so-called ‚Äúpatent trolls.‚Äù [65] ## Totaro maintained that one should not be cynical about the intellectual property regime. He wondered whether the move would undercut the value of Tesla Motors. Totaro argued that Musk could do more if he was truly committed to an open source model: ‚ÄòIf Mr. Musk would be willing to redistribute his wealth to the employees and investors who made the commitment to create value for the company in the first place, then this move to open source their patents during the formative stages of the EV industry might make more sense.‚Äô [66] It should also be noted that Tesla Motors has not abandoned its intellectual property entirely. he company has only offered access for ‚Äògood faith‚Äô uses of its patents ‚Äî which still leaves open the prospect of the company taking action against ‚Äòbad faith‚Äô uses of its patents. Professor Orly Lobel from the University of San Diego commented: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a lot of thinking in the research these days on the gap between the codified knowledge that is patentable and gets disclosed versus tacit knowledge that really exists in how you actually produce‚Äô. [67] She noted: ‚ÄòThat gap is probably relevant in this market.‚Äô [68] Her\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_9]\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\'text\', text=\'to our way of life.‚Äô [85] The pair concluded: ‚ÄòWe need to take the sum of mankind‚Äôs knowledge about sustainable technologies and industries, and share it for the sake of the planet and the future generations that will inhabit it.‚Äô [86] Similarly, the futurist Jeremy Rifkin considers the rise of collaborative commons in his recent book, The Zero Marginal Cost Society. [87] He has observed that ‚Äòa powerful new technology revolution is emerging that is going to fundamentally alter our economic life.‚Äô [88] Rifkin predicts: ‚ÄòThe plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy ‚Äî part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons ‚Äî with far reaching implications for society.‚Äô [89] Rifkin envisages: ‚ÄòMillions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to 83 Don Tapscott, and Anthony Williams, *MacroWikinomics: New Solutions for a Connected Planet*, London: Atlantic Books, 2010. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Jeremy Rifkin, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of things, The Collaborative Commons,* *and the Eclipse of Capitalism*, New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2014. 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid. 24 ----- ## the global Collaborative Commons.‚Äô [90] He observes: ‚ÄòProsumers are plugging into the fledgling Internet of Things (IoT) and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost.‚Äô [91] Rifkin‚Äôs thesis is that monopoly capitalism will be displayed by a collaborative commons. [92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: ‚ÄòIf ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.‚Äô [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

The announcement by Tesla Motors also promoted a wider discussion about economics, business, and innovation in respect of the automobile industry. Professor Joshua Gans, an economist from the University of Toronto, commented, ‚ÄòIt is 448 words that I believe (despite its length) may well become the Gettysburg Address for entrepreneurship and innovation.‚Äô [94] In his address, Elon Musk emphasized: ‚ÄòTechnology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world‚Äôs most 94 Joshua Gans, ‚ÄòIntellectual Property Strategy as Public Relations‚Äô, Digitopoly, 12 June 2014, http://www.digitopoly.org/2014/06/12/intellectual -\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_12]\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\'text\', text=\'used for transportation and grid storage. Electric vehicles can be charged at work and become a source as well as a user of energy for the home. The result will be a swift transition from liquid-energy transportation to electric transportation. [109] ## Seba admits that ‚Äòan electric vehicle is still more expensive to purchase upfront, mainly due to battery costs‚Äô. [110] He predicts that ‚Äòlike other technology products, the technology cost curve of electric vehicles points to a disruption soon; innovative business models will only accelerate the transition from gasoline to electric vehicles.‚Äô [111] It is certainly notable that Elon Musk has investments in both electric cars and solar energy. The entrepreneur obviously sees synergies in respect of his ventures. 108 Ibid., 9. 109 Ibid. 9. 110 Ibid., 8. 111 Ibid., 8. 30 ----- ## Silicon Valley entrepreneur Aaron Levie, the CEO of Box Inc observed: ‚ÄòBy opening its patents, Tesla rightly realises it‚Äôs better to be the best product in a large industry than the only product in a niche one.‚Äô [112] Tesla Motors has been in discussions with BMW about standardizing electric cars. A BMW spokesman said: ‚ÄòBoth companies are strongly committed to the success of electro-mobility and discussed how to further strengthen the development of electro-mobility on an international level.‚Äô [113] There has been speculation about the development of a long-term deal between the two companies. [114] Writing in Slate, Will Oremus considered the announcement of Tesla Motors from a business perspective.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: ‚ÄòOur roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 ----- ## software engineering‚Äô. [3] The company observes: ‚ÄòWe believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.‚Äô [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors‚Äô biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X.\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0]\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\'text\', text=\'with regard to patents.‚Äô [61] She observed: ‚ÄòA lot of companies in the high tech space are dismayed with how the system is shaping up, so they‚Äôre trying to come up with creative ways to navigating around that system and get back to the business of innovating and creating.‚Äô [62] The announcement of Tesla Motors may help provide impetus for President Barack Obama‚Äôs efforts to address the problem of patent trolls and reduce patent litigation. Some members of the intellectual property profession have defended the legitimacy of the patent regime in light of Elon Musk‚Äôs comments. Philip Totaro provided a thoughtful riposte. [63] He observed: ‚ÄòWhile this is a noble and well-intentioned move, unfortunately, this thought process represents a widely held misconception about intellectual property: that it is only a legal matter, rather than a commercial one.‚Äô [64] Totaro responded: Patents are not just about hitting the ‚Äòlitigation lottery‚Äô as Mr. Musk put it. Patents are the codification of innovation and they represent the investment of time and effort from the innovative and creative people who have their names on them. Making the investment in intellectual property protection in the first place presumes that you are willing and able to enforce your rights. In any market there will be 61 Julie Samuels quoted in Klint Finley, ‚ÄòWith Patent Giveaway, Tesla shows Silicon Valley What Ingenuity Means‚Äô, *Wired*, 13 June 2014, http://www.wired.com/2014/06/tesla - patents/?mbid = social _ twitter 62 Ibid. 63 Philip Totaro, ‚ÄòIn Defense of IPR: The Timing of the Tesla Move will Diminish the Company‚Äôs Value‚Äô, *Green Patent Blog,* 19 June 2014, http://www.greenpatentblog.com/2014/06/19/in - defense - of - ipr - the timing - of - the - tesla - move - will - diminish - the - company%e2%80%99s - value/ 64 Ibid. 19 ----- those who are driven by greed, and we have seen the exploitation of intellectual property by so-called ‚Äúpatent trolls.‚Äù [65] ## Totaro maintained that one should not be cynical about the intellectual property regime. He wondered whether the move would undercut the value of Tesla Motors. Totaro argued that Musk could do more if he was truly committed to an open source model: ‚ÄòIf Mr. Musk would be willing to redistribute his wealth to the employees and investors who made the commitment to create value for the company in the first place, then this move to open source their patents during the formative stages of the EV industry might make more sense.‚Äô [66] It should also be noted that Tesla Motors has not abandoned its intellectual property entirely. he company has only offered access for ‚Äògood faith‚Äô uses of its patents ‚Äî which still leaves open the prospect of the company taking action against ‚Äòbad faith‚Äô uses of its patents. Professor Orly Lobel from the University of San Diego commented: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a lot of thinking in the research these days on the gap between the codified knowledge that is patentable and gets disclosed versus tacit knowledge that really exists in how you actually produce‚Äô. [67] She noted: ‚ÄòThat gap is probably relevant in this market.‚Äô [68] Her\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_9]\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\'text\', text=\'to our way of life.‚Äô [85] The pair concluded: ‚ÄòWe need to take the sum of mankind‚Äôs knowledge about sustainable technologies and industries, and share it for the sake of the planet and the future generations that will inhabit it.‚Äô [86] Similarly, the futurist Jeremy Rifkin considers the rise of collaborative commons in his recent book, The Zero Marginal Cost Society. [87] He has observed that ‚Äòa powerful new technology revolution is emerging that is going to fundamentally alter our economic life.‚Äô [88] Rifkin predicts: ‚ÄòThe plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy ‚Äî part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons ‚Äî with far reaching implications for society.‚Äô [89] Rifkin envisages: ‚ÄòMillions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to 83 Don Tapscott, and Anthony Williams, *MacroWikinomics: New Solutions for a Connected Planet*, London: Atlantic Books, 2010. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Jeremy Rifkin, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of things, The Collaborative Commons,* *and the Eclipse of Capitalism*, New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2014. 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid. 24 ----- ## the global Collaborative Commons.‚Äô [90] He observes: ‚ÄòProsumers are plugging into the fledgling Internet of Things (IoT) and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost.‚Äô [91] Rifkin‚Äôs thesis is that monopoly capitalism will be displayed by a collaborative commons. [92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: ‚ÄòIf ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.‚Äô [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

[63] He observed: ‚ÄòWhile this is a noble and well-intentioned move, unfortunately, this thought process represents a widely held misconception about intellectual property: that it is only a legal matter, rather than a commercial one.‚Äô [64] Totaro responded: Patents are not just about hitting the ‚Äòlitigation lottery‚Äô as Mr. Musk put it. Patents are the codification of innovation and they represent the investment of time and effort from the innovative and creative people who have their names on them. Making the investment in intellectual property protection in the first place presumes that you are willing and able to enforce your rights.

He wondered whether the move would undercut the value of Tesla Motors. Totaro argued that Musk could do more if he was truly committed to an open source model: ‚ÄòIf Mr. Musk would be willing to redistribute his wealth to the employees and investors who made the commitment to create value for the company in the first place, then this move to open source their patents during the formative stages of the EV industry might make more sense.‚Äô [66] It should also be noted that Tesla Motors has not abandoned its intellectual property entirely. he company has only offered access for ‚Äògood faith‚Äô uses of its patents ‚Äî which still leaves open the prospect of the company taking action against ‚Äòbad faith‚Äô uses of its patents. Professor Orly Lobel from the University of San Diego commented: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a lot of thinking in the research these days on the gap between the codified knowledge that is patentable and gets disclosed versus tacit knowledge that really exists in how you actually produce‚Äô. [67] She noted: ‚ÄòThat gap is probably relevant in this market.‚Äô [68] Her\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_9]\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\'text\', text=\'to our way of life.‚Äô [85] The pair concluded: ‚ÄòWe need to take the sum of mankind‚Äôs knowledge about sustainable technologies and industries, and share it for the sake of the planet and the future generations that will inhabit it.‚Äô [86] Similarly, the futurist Jeremy Rifkin considers the rise of collaborative commons in his recent book, The Zero Marginal Cost Society. [87] He has observed that ‚Äòa powerful new technology revolution is emerging that is going to fundamentally alter our economic life.‚Äô [88] Rifkin predicts: ‚ÄòThe plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy ‚Äî part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons ‚Äî with far reaching implications for society.‚Äô [89] Rifkin envisages: ‚ÄòMillions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to 83 Don Tapscott, and Anthony Williams, *MacroWikinomics: New Solutions for a Connected Planet*, London: Atlantic Books, 2010. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Jeremy Rifkin, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of things, The Collaborative Commons,* *and the Eclipse of Capitalism*, New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2014. 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid. 24 ----- ## the global Collaborative Commons.‚Äô [90] He observes: ‚ÄòProsumers are plugging into the fledgling Internet of Things (IoT) and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost.‚Äô [91] Rifkin‚Äôs thesis is that monopoly capitalism will be displayed by a collaborative commons. [92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: ‚ÄòIf ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.‚Äô [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

[7] Traditionally, Tesla Motors had professed to take a strict approach to the protection of intellectual property. In 2012, the company observed: ‚ÄòOur business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.‚Äô [8] Tesla Motors warned: Any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing our vehicles.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: ‚ÄòOur roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 ----- ## software engineering‚Äô. [3] The company observes: ‚ÄòWe believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.‚Äô [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: ‚ÄòOur roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 ----- ## software engineering‚Äô. [3] The company observes: ‚ÄòWe believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.‚Äô [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors‚Äô biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X.\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0]\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\'text\', text=\'with regard to patents.‚Äô [61] She observed: ‚ÄòA lot of companies in the high tech space are dismayed with how the system is shaping up, so they‚Äôre trying to come up with creative ways to navigating around that system and get back to the business of innovating and creating.‚Äô [62] The announcement of Tesla Motors may help provide impetus for President Barack Obama‚Äôs efforts to address the problem of patent trolls and reduce patent litigation. Some members of the intellectual property profession have defended the legitimacy of the patent regime in light of Elon Musk‚Äôs comments. Philip Totaro provided a thoughtful riposte. [63] He observed: ‚ÄòWhile this is a noble and well-intentioned move, unfortunately, this thought process represents a widely held misconception about intellectual property: that it is only a legal matter, rather than a commercial one.‚Äô [64] Totaro responded: Patents are not just about hitting the ‚Äòlitigation lottery‚Äô as Mr. Musk put it. Patents are the codification of innovation and they represent the investment of time and effort from the innovative and creative people who have their names on them. Making the investment in intellectual property protection in the first place presumes that you are willing and able to enforce your rights. In any market there will be 61 Julie Samuels quoted in Klint Finley, ‚ÄòWith Patent Giveaway, Tesla shows Silicon Valley What Ingenuity Means‚Äô, *Wired*, 13 June 2014, http://www.wired.com/2014/06/tesla - patents/?mbid = social _ twitter 62 Ibid. 63 Philip Totaro, ‚ÄòIn Defense of IPR: The Timing of the Tesla Move will Diminish the Company‚Äôs Value‚Äô, *Green Patent Blog,* 19 June 2014, http://www.greenpatentblog.com/2014/06/19/in - defense - of - ipr - the timing - of - the - tesla - move - will - diminish - the - company%e2%80%99s - value/ 64 Ibid. 19 ----- those who are driven by greed, and we have seen the exploitation of intellectual property by so-called ‚Äúpatent trolls.‚Äù [65] ## Totaro maintained that one should not be cynical about the intellectual property regime. He wondered whether the move would undercut the value of Tesla Motors. Totaro argued that Musk could do more if he was truly committed to an open source model: ‚ÄòIf Mr. Musk would be willing to redistribute his wealth to the employees and investors who made the commitment to create value for the company in the first place, then this move to open source their patents during the formative stages of the EV industry might make more sense.‚Äô [66] It should also be noted that Tesla Motors has not abandoned its intellectual property entirely. he company has only offered access for ‚Äògood faith‚Äô uses of its patents ‚Äî which still leaves open the prospect of the company taking action against ‚Äòbad faith‚Äô uses of its patents. Professor Orly Lobel from the University of San Diego commented: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a lot of thinking in the research these days on the gap between the codified knowledge that is patentable and gets disclosed versus tacit knowledge that really exists in how you actually produce‚Äô. [67] She noted: ‚ÄòThat gap is probably relevant in this market.‚Äô [68] Her\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_9]\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\'text\', text=\'to our way of life.‚Äô [85] The pair concluded: ‚ÄòWe need to take the sum of mankind‚Äôs knowledge about sustainable technologies and industries, and share it for the sake of the planet and the future generations that will inhabit it.‚Äô [86] Similarly, the futurist Jeremy Rifkin considers the rise of collaborative commons in his recent book, The Zero Marginal Cost Society. [87] He has observed that ‚Äòa powerful new technology revolution is emerging that is going to fundamentally alter our economic life.‚Äô [88] Rifkin predicts: ‚ÄòThe plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy ‚Äî part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons ‚Äî with far reaching implications for society.‚Äô [89] Rifkin envisages: ‚ÄòMillions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to 83 Don Tapscott, and Anthony Williams, *MacroWikinomics: New Solutions for a Connected Planet*, London: Atlantic Books, 2010. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Jeremy Rifkin, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of things, The Collaborative Commons,* *and the Eclipse of Capitalism*, New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2014. 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid. 24 ----- ## the global Collaborative Commons.‚Äô [90] He observes: ‚ÄòProsumers are plugging into the fledgling Internet of Things (IoT) and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost.‚Äô [91] Rifkin‚Äôs thesis is that monopoly capitalism will be displayed by a collaborative commons. [92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: ‚ÄòIf ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.‚Äô [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

The announcement by Tesla Motors also promoted a wider discussion about economics, business, and innovation in respect of the automobile industry. Professor Joshua Gans, an economist from the University of Toronto, commented, ‚ÄòIt is 448 words that I believe (despite its length) may well become the Gettysburg Address for entrepreneurship and innovation.‚Äô [94] In his address, Elon Musk emphasized: ‚ÄòTechnology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world‚Äôs most 94 Joshua Gans, ‚ÄòIntellectual Property Strategy as Public Relations‚Äô, Digitopoly, 12 June 2014, http://www.digitopoly.org/2014/06/12/intellectual -\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_12]\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\'text\', text=\'used for transportation and grid storage. Electric vehicles can be charged at work and become a source as well as a user of energy for the home. The result will be a swift transition from liquid-energy transportation to electric transportation. [109] ## Seba admits that ‚Äòan electric vehicle is still more expensive to purchase upfront, mainly due to battery costs‚Äô. [110] He predicts that ‚Äòlike other technology products, the technology cost curve of electric vehicles points to a disruption soon; innovative business models will only accelerate the transition from gasoline to electric vehicles.‚Äô [111] It is certainly notable that Elon Musk has investments in both electric cars and solar energy. The entrepreneur obviously sees synergies in respect of his ventures. 108 Ibid., 9. 109 Ibid. 9. 110 Ibid., 8. 111 Ibid., 8. 30 ----- ## Silicon Valley entrepreneur Aaron Levie, the CEO of Box Inc observed: ‚ÄòBy opening its patents, Tesla rightly realises it‚Äôs better to be the best product in a large industry than the only product in a niche one.‚Äô [112] Tesla Motors has been in discussions with BMW about standardizing electric cars. A BMW spokesman said: ‚ÄòBoth companies are strongly committed to the success of electro-mobility and discussed how to further strengthen the development of electro-mobility on an international level.‚Äô [113] There has been speculation about the development of a long-term deal between the two companies. [114] Writing in Slate, Will Oremus considered the announcement of Tesla Motors from a business perspective. He recognised: ‚ÄòThis might seem like a rash move for a company that still faces big hurdles on its path to long-term, mainstream success.‚Äô [115] Oremus anticipated a polarised 112 Associated Press, ‚ÄòTesla Hands Over the Keys to its Electric Car Technology‚Äô, *The Guardian*, 14 June 2014, http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/13/tesla - elon - musk - electric - cars - patent technology?CMP = twt _ gu 113 Edward Taylor, ‚ÄòBMW and Tesla Executives Meet to Discuss Electric Cars‚Äô, *Business Insider*, Reuters, 13 June 2014, http://www.businessinsider.com/r - bmw - and - tesla - executives - meet - to - discuss - electric - cars - 2014 13?IR = T 114 Neil Winton, ‚ÄòTesla Giveaway Spurs Speculation of Possible Deal with BMW‚Äô, *Forbes*, 13 June 2014, http://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2014/06/13/tesla - patent - giveaway - spurs - speculation - of - possible - deal with - bmw/ 115 Will Oremus, ‚ÄòTesla is Opening Its Patents to All.

[67] She noted: ‚ÄòThat gap is probably relevant in this market.‚Äô [68] Her\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_9]\\\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\\'text\\\', text=\\\'to our way of life.‚Äô [85] The pair concluded: ‚ÄòWe need to take the sum of mankind‚Äôs knowledge about sustainable technologies and industries, and share it for the sake of the planet and the future generations that will inhabit it.‚Äô [86] Similarly, the futurist Jeremy Rifkin considers the rise of collaborative commons in his recent book, The Zero Marginal Cost Society. [87] He has observed that ‚Äòa powerful new technology revolution is emerging that is going to fundamentally alter our economic life.‚Äô [88] Rifkin predicts: ‚ÄòThe plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy ‚Äî part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons ‚Äî with far reaching implications for society.‚Äô [89] Rifkin envisages: ‚ÄòMillions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to 83 Don Tapscott, and Anthony Williams, *MacroWikinomics: New Solutions for a Connected Planet*, London: Atlantic Books, 2010. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Jeremy Rifkin, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of things, The Collaborative Commons,* *and the Eclipse of Capitalism*, New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2014. 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid. 24 ----- ## the global Collaborative Commons.‚Äô [90] He observes: ‚ÄòProsumers are plugging into the fledgling Internet of Things (IoT) and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost.‚Äô [91] Rifkin‚Äôs thesis is that monopoly capitalism will be displayed by a collaborative commons. [92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: ‚ÄòIf ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.‚Äô [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

Professor Joshua Gans, an economist from the University of Toronto, commented, ‚ÄòIt is 448 words that I believe (despite its length) may well become the Gettysburg Address for entrepreneurship and innovation.‚Äô [94] In his address, Elon Musk emphasized: ‚ÄòTechnology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world‚Äôs most 94 Joshua Gans, ‚ÄòIntellectual Property Strategy as Public Relations‚Äô, Digitopoly, 12 June 2014, http://www.digitopoly.org/2014/06/12/intellectual -\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_12]\\\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\\'text\\\', text=\\\'used for transportation and grid storage.

[110] He predicts that ‚Äòlike other technology products, the technology cost curve of electric vehicles points to a disruption soon; innovative business models will only accelerate the transition from gasoline to electric vehicles.‚Äô [111] It is certainly notable that Elon Musk has investments in both electric cars and solar energy.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: ‚ÄòOur roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 ----- ## software engineering‚Äô. [3] The company observes: ‚ÄòWe believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.‚Äô [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors‚Äô biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X.\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0]\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\'text\', text=\'with regard to patents.‚Äô [61] She observed: ‚ÄòA lot of companies in the high tech space are dismayed with how the system is shaping up, so they‚Äôre trying to come up with creative ways to navigating around that system and get back to the business of innovating and creating.‚Äô [62] The announcement of Tesla Motors may help provide impetus for President Barack Obama‚Äôs efforts to address the problem of patent trolls and reduce patent litigation. Some members of the intellectual property profession have defended the legitimacy of the patent regime in light of Elon Musk‚Äôs comments. Philip Totaro provided a thoughtful riposte. [63] He observed: ‚ÄòWhile this is a noble and well-intentioned move, unfortunately, this thought process represents a widely held misconception about intellectual property: that it is only a legal matter, rather than a commercial one.‚Äô [64] Totaro responded: Patents are not just about hitting the ‚Äòlitigation lottery‚Äô as Mr. Musk put it. Patents are the codification of innovation and they represent the investment of time and effort from the innovative and creative people who have their names on them. Making the investment in intellectual property protection in the first place presumes that you are willing and able to enforce your rights. In any market there will be 61 Julie Samuels quoted in Klint Finley, ‚ÄòWith Patent Giveaway, Tesla shows Silicon Valley What Ingenuity Means‚Äô, *Wired*, 13 June 2014, http://www.wired.com/2014/06/tesla - patents/?mbid = social _ twitter 62 Ibid. 63 Philip Totaro, ‚ÄòIn Defense of IPR: The Timing of the Tesla Move will Diminish the Company‚Äôs Value‚Äô, *Green Patent Blog,* 19 June 2014, http://www.greenpatentblog.com/2014/06/19/in - defense - of - ipr - the timing - of - the - tesla - move - will - diminish - the - company%e2%80%99s - value/ 64 Ibid. 19 ----- those who are driven by greed, and we have seen the exploitation of intellectual property by so-called ‚Äúpatent trolls.‚Äù [65] ## Totaro maintained that one should not be cynical about the intellectual property regime. He wondered whether the move would undercut the value of Tesla Motors. Totaro argued that Musk could do more if he was truly committed to an open source model: ‚ÄòIf Mr. Musk would be willing to redistribute his wealth to the employees and investors who made the commitment to create value for the company in the first place, then this move to open source their patents during the formative stages of the EV industry might make more sense.‚Äô [66] It should also be noted that Tesla Motors has not abandoned its intellectual property entirely. he company has only offered access for ‚Äògood faith‚Äô uses of its patents ‚Äî which still leaves open the prospect of the company taking action against ‚Äòbad faith‚Äô uses of its patents. Professor Orly Lobel from the University of San Diego commented: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a lot of thinking in the research these days on the gap between the codified knowledge that is patentable and gets disclosed versus tacit knowledge that really exists in how you actually produce‚Äô.

[7] Traditionally, Tesla Motors had professed to take a strict approach to the protection of intellectual property. In 2012, the company observed: ‚ÄòOur business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.‚Äô [8] Tesla Motors warned: Any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing our vehicles.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: ‚ÄòOur roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 ----- ## software engineering‚Äô. [3] The company observes: ‚ÄòWe believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.‚Äô [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors‚Äô biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X.\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0]\\\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\\'text\\\', text=\\\'with regard to patents.‚Äô [61] She observed: ‚ÄòA lot of companies in the high tech space are dismayed with how the system is shaping up, so they‚Äôre trying to come up with creative ways to navigating around that system and get back to the business of innovating and creating.‚Äô [62] The announcement of Tesla Motors may help provide impetus for President Barack Obama‚Äôs efforts to address the problem of patent trolls and reduce patent litigation. Some members of the intellectual property profession have defended the legitimacy of the patent regime in light of Elon Musk‚Äôs comments. Philip Totaro provided a thoughtful riposte. [63] He observed: ‚ÄòWhile this is a noble and well-intentioned move, unfortunately, this thought process represents a widely held misconception about intellectual property: that it is only a legal matter, rather than a commercial one.‚Äô [64] Totaro responded: Patents are not just about hitting the ‚Äòlitigation lottery‚Äô as Mr. Musk put it. Patents are the codification of innovation and they represent the investment of time and effort from the innovative and creative people who have their names on them. Making the investment in intellectual property protection in the first place presumes that you are willing and able to enforce your rights. In any market there will be 61 Julie Samuels quoted in Klint Finley, ‚ÄòWith Patent Giveaway, Tesla shows Silicon Valley What Ingenuity Means‚Äô, *Wired*, 13 June 2014, http://www.wired.com/2014/06/tesla - patents/?mbid = social _ twitter 62 Ibid. 63 Philip Totaro, ‚ÄòIn Defense of IPR: The Timing of the Tesla Move will Diminish the Company‚Äôs Value‚Äô, *Green Patent Blog,* 19 June 2014, http://www.greenpatentblog.com/2014/06/19/in - defense - of - ipr - the timing - of - the - tesla - move - will - diminish - the - company%e2%80%99s - value/ 64 Ibid. 19 ----- those who are driven by greed, and we have seen the exploitation of intellectual property by so-called ‚Äúpatent trolls.‚Äù [65] ## Totaro maintained that one should not be cynical about the intellectual property regime. He wondered whether the move would undercut the value of Tesla Motors. Totaro argued that Musk could do more if he was truly committed to an open source model: ‚ÄòIf Mr. Musk would be willing to redistribute his wealth to the employees and investors who made the commitment to create value for the company in the first place, then this move to open source their patents during the formative stages of the EV industry might make more sense.‚Äô [66] It should also be noted that Tesla Motors has not abandoned its intellectual property entirely. he company has only offered access for ‚Äògood faith‚Äô uses of its patents ‚Äî which still leaves open the prospect of the company taking action against ‚Äòbad faith‚Äô uses of its patents.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: ‚ÄòOur roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 ----- ## software engineering‚Äô. [3] The company observes: ‚ÄòWe believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.‚Äô [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors‚Äô biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X.\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0]\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\'text\', text=\'with regard to patents.‚Äô [61] She observed: ‚ÄòA lot of companies in the high tech space are dismayed with how the system is shaping up, so they‚Äôre trying to come up with creative ways to navigating around that system and get back to the business of innovating and creating.‚Äô [62] The announcement of Tesla Motors may help provide impetus for President Barack Obama‚Äôs efforts to address the problem of patent trolls and reduce patent litigation. Some members of the intellectual property profession have defended the legitimacy of the patent regime in light of Elon Musk‚Äôs comments. Philip Totaro provided a thoughtful riposte. [63] He observed: ‚ÄòWhile this is a noble and well-intentioned move, unfortunately, this thought process represents a widely held misconception about intellectual property: that it is only a legal matter, rather than a commercial one.‚Äô [64] Totaro responded: Patents are not just about hitting the ‚Äòlitigation lottery‚Äô as Mr. Musk put it. Patents are the codification of innovation and they represent the investment of time and effort from the innovative and creative people who have their names on them. Making the investment in intellectual property protection in the first place presumes that you are willing and able to enforce your rights. In any market there will be 61 Julie Samuels quoted in Klint Finley, ‚ÄòWith Patent Giveaway, Tesla shows Silicon Valley What Ingenuity Means‚Äô, *Wired*, 13 June 2014, http://www.wired.com/2014/06/tesla - patents/?mbid = social _ twitter 62 Ibid. 63 Philip Totaro, ‚ÄòIn Defense of IPR: The Timing of the Tesla Move will Diminish the Company‚Äôs Value‚Äô, *Green Patent Blog,* 19 June 2014, http://www.greenpatentblog.com/2014/06/19/in - defense - of - ipr - the timing - of - the - tesla - move - will - diminish - the - company%e2%80%99s - value/ 64 Ibid. 19 ----- those who are driven by greed, and we have seen the exploitation of intellectual property by so-called ‚Äúpatent trolls.‚Äù [65] ## Totaro maintained that one should not be cynical about the intellectual property regime. He wondered whether the move would undercut the value of Tesla Motors. Totaro argued that Musk could do more if he was truly committed to an open source model: ‚ÄòIf Mr. Musk would be willing to redistribute his wealth to the employees and investors who made the commitment to create value for the company in the first place, then this move to open source their patents during the formative stages of the EV industry might make more sense.‚Äô [66] It should also be noted that Tesla Motors has not abandoned its intellectual property entirely. he company has only offered access for ‚Äògood faith‚Äô uses of its patents ‚Äî which still leaves open the prospect of the company taking action against ‚Äòbad faith‚Äô uses of its patents. Professor Orly Lobel from the University of San Diego commented: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a lot of thinking in the research these days on the gap between the codified knowledge that is patentable and gets disclosed versus tacit knowledge that really exists in how you actually produce‚Äô. [67] She noted: ‚ÄòThat gap is probably relevant in this market.‚Äô [68] Her\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_9]\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\'text\', text=\'to our way of life.‚Äô [85] The pair concluded: ‚ÄòWe need to take the sum of mankind‚Äôs knowledge about sustainable technologies and industries, and share it for the sake of the planet and the future generations that will inhabit it.‚Äô [86] Similarly, the futurist Jeremy Rifkin considers the rise of collaborative commons in his recent book, The Zero Marginal Cost Society. [87] He has observed that ‚Äòa powerful new technology revolution is emerging that is going to fundamentally alter our economic life.‚Äô [88] Rifkin predicts: ‚ÄòThe plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy ‚Äî part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons ‚Äî with far reaching implications for society.‚Äô [89] Rifkin envisages: ‚ÄòMillions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to 83 Don Tapscott, and Anthony Williams, *MacroWikinomics: New Solutions for a Connected Planet*, London: Atlantic Books, 2010. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Jeremy Rifkin, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of things, The Collaborative Commons,* *and the Eclipse of Capitalism*, New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2014. 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid. 24 ----- ## the global Collaborative Commons.‚Äô [90] He observes: ‚ÄòProsumers are plugging into the fledgling Internet of Things (IoT) and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost.‚Äô [91] Rifkin‚Äôs thesis is that monopoly capitalism will be displayed by a collaborative commons. [92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: ‚ÄòIf ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.‚Äô [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

The announcement by Tesla Motors also promoted a wider discussion about economics, business, and innovation in respect of the automobile industry. Professor Joshua Gans, an economist from the University of Toronto, commented, ‚ÄòIt is 448 words that I believe (despite its length) may well become the Gettysburg Address for entrepreneurship and innovation.‚Äô [94] In his address, Elon Musk emphasized: ‚ÄòTechnology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world‚Äôs most 94 Joshua Gans, ‚ÄòIntellectual Property Strategy as Public Relations‚Äô, Digitopoly, 12 June 2014, http://www.digitopoly.org/2014/06/12/intellectual -\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_12]\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\'text\', text=\'used for transportation and grid storage. Electric vehicles can be charged at work and become a source as well as a user of energy for the home. The result will be a swift transition from liquid-energy transportation to electric transportation. [109] ## Seba admits that ‚Äòan electric vehicle is still more expensive to purchase upfront, mainly due to battery costs‚Äô. [110] He predicts that ‚Äòlike other technology products, the technology cost curve of electric vehicles points to a disruption soon; innovative business models will only accelerate the transition from gasoline to electric vehicles.‚Äô [111] It is certainly notable that Elon Musk has investments in both electric cars and solar energy. The entrepreneur obviously sees synergies in respect of his ventures. 108 Ibid., 9. 109 Ibid. 9. 110 Ibid., 8. 111 Ibid., 8. 30 ----- ## Silicon Valley entrepreneur Aaron Levie, the CEO of Box Inc observed: ‚ÄòBy opening its patents, Tesla rightly realises it‚Äôs better to be the best product in a large industry than the only product in a niche one.‚Äô [112] Tesla Motors has been in discussions with BMW about standardizing electric cars. A BMW spokesman said: ‚ÄòBoth companies are strongly committed to the success of electro-mobility and discussed how to further strengthen the development of electro-mobility on an international level.‚Äô [113] There has been speculation about the development of a long-term deal between the two companies. [114] Writing in Slate, Will Oremus considered the announcement of Tesla Motors from a business perspective. He recognised: ‚ÄòThis might seem like a rash move for a company that still faces big hurdles on its path to long-term, mainstream success.‚Äô [115] Oremus anticipated a polarised 112 Associated Press, ‚ÄòTesla Hands Over the Keys to its Electric Car Technology‚Äô, *The Guardian*, 14 June 2014, http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/13/tesla - elon - musk - electric - cars - patent technology?CMP = twt _ gu 113 Edward Taylor, ‚ÄòBMW and Tesla Executives Meet to Discuss Electric Cars‚Äô, *Business Insider*, Reuters, 13 June 2014, http://www.businessinsider.com/r - bmw - and - tesla - executives - meet - to - discuss - electric - cars - 2014 13?IR = T 114 Neil Winton, ‚ÄòTesla Giveaway Spurs Speculation of Possible Deal with BMW‚Äô, *Forbes*, 13 June 2014, http://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2014/06/13/tesla - patent - giveaway - spurs - speculation - of - possible - deal with - bmw/ 115 Will Oremus, ‚ÄòTesla is Opening Its Patents to All.

To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: ‚ÄòOur roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 ----- ## software engineering‚Äô. [3] The company observes: ‚ÄòWe believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.‚Äô [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors‚Äô biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X.\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0]\\\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\\'text\\\', text=\\\'with regard to patents.‚Äô [61] She observed: ‚ÄòA lot of companies in the high tech space are dismayed with how the system is shaping up, so they‚Äôre trying to come up with creative ways to navigating around that system and get back to the business of innovating and creating.‚Äô [62] The announcement of Tesla Motors may help provide impetus for President Barack Obama‚Äôs efforts to address the problem of patent trolls and reduce patent litigation. Some members of the intellectual property profession have defended the legitimacy of the patent regime in light of Elon Musk‚Äôs comments. Philip Totaro provided a thoughtful riposte. [63] He observed: ‚ÄòWhile this is a noble and well-intentioned move, unfortunately, this thought process represents a widely held misconception about intellectual property: that it is only a legal matter, rather than a commercial one.‚Äô [64] Totaro responded: Patents are not just about hitting the ‚Äòlitigation lottery‚Äô as Mr. Musk put it. Patents are the codification of innovation and they represent the investment of time and effort from the innovative and creative people who have their names on them. Making the investment in intellectual property protection in the first place presumes that you are willing and able to enforce your rights. In any market there will be 61 Julie Samuels quoted in Klint Finley, ‚ÄòWith Patent Giveaway, Tesla shows Silicon Valley What Ingenuity Means‚Äô, *Wired*, 13 June 2014, http://www.wired.com/2014/06/tesla - patents/?mbid = social _ twitter 62 Ibid. 63 Philip Totaro, ‚ÄòIn Defense of IPR: The Timing of the Tesla Move will Diminish the Company‚Äôs Value‚Äô, *Green Patent Blog,* 19 June 2014, http://www.greenpatentblog.com/2014/06/19/in - defense - of - ipr - the timing - of - the - tesla - move - will - diminish - the - company%e2%80%99s - value/ 64 Ibid. 19 ----- those who are driven by greed, and we have seen the exploitation of intellectual property by so-called ‚Äúpatent trolls.‚Äù [65] ## Totaro maintained that one should not be cynical about the intellectual property regime. He wondered whether the move would undercut the value of Tesla Motors. Totaro argued that Musk could do more if he was truly committed to an open source model: ‚ÄòIf Mr. Musk would be willing to redistribute his wealth to the employees and investors who made the commitment to create value for the company in the first place, then this move to open source their patents during the formative stages of the EV industry might make more sense.‚Äô [66] It should also be noted that Tesla Motors has not abandoned its intellectual property entirely. he company has only offered access for ‚Äògood faith‚Äô uses of its patents ‚Äî which still leaves open the prospect of the company taking action against ‚Äòbad faith‚Äô uses of its patents. Professor Orly Lobel from the University of San Diego commented: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a lot of thinking in the research these days on the gap between the codified knowledge that is patentable and gets disclosed versus tacit knowledge that really exists in how you actually produce‚Äô. [67] She noted: ‚ÄòThat gap is probably relevant in this market.‚Äô [68] Her\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_9]\\\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\\'text\\\', text=\\\'to our way of life.‚Äô [85] The pair concluded: ‚ÄòWe need to take the sum of mankind‚Äôs knowledge about sustainable technologies and industries, and share it for the sake of the planet and the future generations that will inhabit it.‚Äô [86] Similarly, the futurist Jeremy Rifkin considers the rise of collaborative commons in his recent book, The Zero Marginal Cost Society. [87] He has observed that ‚Äòa powerful new technology revolution is emerging that is going to fundamentally alter our economic life.‚Äô [88] Rifkin predicts: ‚ÄòThe plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy ‚Äî part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons ‚Äî with far reaching implications for society.‚Äô [89] Rifkin envisages: ‚ÄòMillions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to 83 Don Tapscott, and Anthony Williams, *MacroWikinomics: New Solutions for a Connected Planet*, London: Atlantic Books, 2010. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Jeremy Rifkin, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of things, The Collaborative Commons,* *and the Eclipse of Capitalism*, New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2014. 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid. 24 ----- ## the global Collaborative Commons.‚Äô [90] He observes: ‚ÄòProsumers are plugging into the fledgling Internet of Things (IoT) and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost.‚Äô [91] Rifkin‚Äôs thesis is that monopoly capitalism will be displayed by a collaborative commons. [92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: ‚ÄòIf ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.‚Äô [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

The announcement by Tesla Motors also promoted a wider discussion about economics, business, and innovation in respect of the automobile industry. Professor Joshua Gans, an economist from the University of Toronto, commented, ‚ÄòIt is 448 words that I believe (despite its length) may well become the Gettysburg Address for entrepreneurship and innovation.‚Äô [94] In his address, Elon Musk emphasized: ‚ÄòTechnology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world‚Äôs most 94 Joshua Gans, ‚ÄòIntellectual Property Strategy as Public Relations‚Äô, Digitopoly, 12 June 2014, http://www.digitopoly.org/2014/06/12/intellectual -\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_12]\\\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\\'text\\\', text=\\\'used for transportation and grid storage. Electric vehicles can be charged at work and become a source as well as a user of energy for the home. The result will be a swift transition from liquid-energy transportation to electric transportation. [109] ## Seba admits that ‚Äòan electric vehicle is still more expensive to purchase upfront, mainly due to battery costs‚Äô. [110] He predicts that ‚Äòlike other technology products, the technology cost curve of electric vehicles points to a disruption soon; innovative business models will only accelerate the transition from gasoline to electric vehicles.‚Äô [111] It is certainly notable that Elon Musk has investments in both electric cars and solar energy. The entrepreneur obviously sees synergies in respect of his ventures. 108 Ibid., 9. 109 Ibid. 9. 110 Ibid., 8. 111 Ibid., 8. 30 ----- ## Silicon Valley entrepreneur Aaron Levie, the CEO of Box Inc observed: ‚ÄòBy opening its patents, Tesla rightly realises it‚Äôs better to be the best product in a large industry than the only product in a niche one.‚Äô [112] Tesla Motors has been in discussions with BMW about standardizing electric cars. A BMW spokesman said: ‚ÄòBoth companies are strongly committed to the success of electro-mobility and discussed how to further strengthen the development of electro-mobility on an international level.‚Äô [113] There has been speculation about the development of a long-term deal between the two companies. [114] Writing in Slate, Will Oremus considered the announcement of Tesla Motors from a business perspective.

In 2012, the company observed: ‚ÄòOur business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.‚Äô [8] Tesla Motors warned: Any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing our vehicles.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: ‚ÄòOur roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 ----- ## software engineering‚Äô. [3] The company observes: ‚ÄòWe believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.‚Äô [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors‚Äô biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X.\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0]\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\'text\', text=\'with regard to patents.‚Äô [61] She observed: ‚ÄòA lot of companies in the high tech space are dismayed with how the system is shaping up, so they‚Äôre trying to come up with creative ways to navigating around that system and get back to the business of innovating and creating.‚Äô [62] The announcement of Tesla Motors may help provide impetus for President Barack Obama‚Äôs efforts to address the problem of patent trolls and reduce patent litigation. Some members of the intellectual property profession have defended the legitimacy of the patent regime in light of Elon Musk‚Äôs comments. Philip Totaro provided a thoughtful riposte. [63] He observed: ‚ÄòWhile this is a noble and well-intentioned move, unfortunately, this thought process represents a widely held misconception about intellectual property: that it is only a legal matter, rather than a commercial one.‚Äô [64] Totaro responded: Patents are not just about hitting the ‚Äòlitigation lottery‚Äô as Mr. Musk put it. Patents are the codification of innovation and they represent the investment of time and effort from the innovative and creative people who have their names on them. Making the investment in intellectual property protection in the first place presumes that you are willing and able to enforce your rights. In any market there will be 61 Julie Samuels quoted in Klint Finley, ‚ÄòWith Patent Giveaway, Tesla shows Silicon Valley What Ingenuity Means‚Äô, *Wired*, 13 June 2014, http://www.wired.com/2014/06/tesla - patents/?mbid = social _ twitter 62 Ibid. 63 Philip Totaro, ‚ÄòIn Defense of IPR: The Timing of the Tesla Move will Diminish the Company‚Äôs Value‚Äô, *Green Patent Blog,* 19 June 2014, http://www.greenpatentblog.com/2014/06/19/in - defense - of - ipr - the timing - of - the - tesla - move - will - diminish - the - company%e2%80%99s - value/ 64 Ibid. 19 ----- those who are driven by greed, and we have seen the exploitation of intellectual property by so-called ‚Äúpatent trolls.‚Äù [65] ## Totaro maintained that one should not be cynical about the intellectual property regime. He wondered whether the move would undercut the value of Tesla Motors. Totaro argued that Musk could do more if he was truly committed to an open source model: ‚ÄòIf Mr. Musk would be willing to redistribute his wealth to the employees and investors who made the commitment to create value for the company in the first place, then this move to open source their patents during the formative stages of the EV industry might make more sense.‚Äô [66] It should also be noted that Tesla Motors has not abandoned its intellectual property entirely. he company has only offered access for ‚Äògood faith‚Äô uses of its patents ‚Äî which still leaves open the prospect of the company taking action against ‚Äòbad faith‚Äô uses of its patents. Professor Orly Lobel from the University of San Diego commented: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a lot of thinking in the research these days on the gap between the codified knowledge that is patentable and gets disclosed versus tacit knowledge that really exists in how you actually produce‚Äô. [67] She noted: ‚ÄòThat gap is probably relevant in this market.‚Äô [68] Her\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_9]\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\'text\', text=\'to our way of life.‚Äô [85] The pair concluded: ‚ÄòWe need to take the sum of mankind‚Äôs knowledge about sustainable technologies and industries, and share it for the sake of the planet and the future generations that will inhabit it.‚Äô [86] Similarly, the futurist Jeremy Rifkin considers the rise of collaborative commons in his recent book, The Zero Marginal Cost Society. [87] He has observed that ‚Äòa powerful new technology revolution is emerging that is going to fundamentally alter our economic life.‚Äô [88] Rifkin predicts: ‚ÄòThe plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy ‚Äî part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons ‚Äî with far reaching implications for society.‚Äô [89] Rifkin envisages: ‚ÄòMillions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to 83 Don Tapscott, and Anthony Williams, *MacroWikinomics: New Solutions for a Connected Planet*, London: Atlantic Books, 2010. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Jeremy Rifkin, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of things, The Collaborative Commons,* *and the Eclipse of Capitalism*, New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2014. 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid. 24 ----- ## the global Collaborative Commons.‚Äô [90] He observes: ‚ÄòProsumers are plugging into the fledgling Internet of Things (IoT) and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost.‚Äô [91] Rifkin‚Äôs thesis is that monopoly capitalism will be displayed by a collaborative commons. [92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: ‚ÄòIf ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.‚Äô [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

There are also striking synergies between his various ventures. Tesla Motors is reinforced by such infrastructure projects as SolarCity [6] and the Gigafactory. [7] Traditionally, Tesla Motors had professed to take a strict approach to the protection of intellectual property. In 2012, the company observed: ‚ÄòOur business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.‚Äô [8] Tesla Motors warned: Any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing our vehicles. [9] ## The strategy of the company was to rely upon a combination of patent law, and other intellectual property rights, to protect the core technology of the company. 6 SolarCity, http://www.solarcity.com/company/team 7 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòGigafactory‚Äô, 26 February 2014, http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/gigafactory 8 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 9 Ibid. 4 ----- ## On the 12th June 2014, Elon Musk, the chief executive officer of the electric car manufacturer, Tesla Motors, announced in a blog that ‚Äòall our patents belong to you.‚Äô [10] He explained that the company would adopt an open source philosophy in respect of its intellectual property in order to encourage the development of the industry of electric cars, and address the carbon crisis.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: ‚ÄòOur roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 ----- ## software engineering‚Äô. [3] The company observes: ‚ÄòWe believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.‚Äô [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors‚Äô biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X.\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0]\\\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\\'text\\\', text=\\\'with regard to patents.‚Äô [61] She observed: ‚ÄòA lot of companies in the high tech space are dismayed with how the system is shaping up, so they‚Äôre trying to come up with creative ways to navigating around that system and get back to the business of innovating and creating.‚Äô [62] The announcement of Tesla Motors may help provide impetus for President Barack Obama‚Äôs efforts to address the problem of patent trolls and reduce patent litigation. Some members of the intellectual property profession have defended the legitimacy of the patent regime in light of Elon Musk‚Äôs comments. Philip Totaro provided a thoughtful riposte. [63] He observed: ‚ÄòWhile this is a noble and well-intentioned move, unfortunately, this thought process represents a widely held misconception about intellectual property: that it is only a legal matter, rather than a commercial one.‚Äô [64] Totaro responded: Patents are not just about hitting the ‚Äòlitigation lottery‚Äô as Mr. Musk put it. Patents are the codification of innovation and they represent the investment of time and effort from the innovative and creative people who have their names on them. Making the investment in intellectual property protection in the first place presumes that you are willing and able to enforce your rights. In any market there will be 61 Julie Samuels quoted in Klint Finley, ‚ÄòWith Patent Giveaway, Tesla shows Silicon Valley What Ingenuity Means‚Äô, *Wired*, 13 June 2014, http://www.wired.com/2014/06/tesla - patents/?mbid = social _ twitter 62 Ibid. 63 Philip Totaro, ‚ÄòIn Defense of IPR: The Timing of the Tesla Move will Diminish the Company‚Äôs Value‚Äô, *Green Patent Blog,* 19 June 2014, http://www.greenpatentblog.com/2014/06/19/in - defense - of - ipr - the timing - of - the - tesla - move - will - diminish - the - company%e2%80%99s - value/ 64 Ibid. 19 ----- those who are driven by greed, and we have seen the exploitation of intellectual property by so-called ‚Äúpatent trolls.‚Äù [65] ## Totaro maintained that one should not be cynical about the intellectual property regime. He wondered whether the move would undercut the value of Tesla Motors. Totaro argued that Musk could do more if he was truly committed to an open source model: ‚ÄòIf Mr. Musk would be willing to redistribute his wealth to the employees and investors who made the commitment to create value for the company in the first place, then this move to open source their patents during the formative stages of the EV industry might make more sense.‚Äô [66] It should also be noted that Tesla Motors has not abandoned its intellectual property entirely. he company has only offered access for ‚Äògood faith‚Äô uses of its patents ‚Äî which still leaves open the prospect of the company taking action against ‚Äòbad faith‚Äô uses of its patents. Professor Orly Lobel from the University of San Diego commented: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a lot of thinking in the research these days on the gap between the codified knowledge that is patentable and gets disclosed versus tacit knowledge that really exists in how you actually produce‚Äô. [67] She noted: ‚ÄòThat gap is probably relevant in this market.‚Äô [68] Her\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_9]\\\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\\'text\\\', text=\\\'to our way of life.‚Äô [85] The pair concluded: ‚ÄòWe need to take the sum of mankind‚Äôs knowledge about sustainable technologies and industries, and share it for the sake of the planet and the future generations that will inhabit it.‚Äô [86] Similarly, the futurist Jeremy Rifkin considers the rise of collaborative commons in his recent book, The Zero Marginal Cost Society. [87] He has observed that ‚Äòa powerful new technology revolution is emerging that is going to fundamentally alter our economic life.‚Äô [88] Rifkin predicts: ‚ÄòThe plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy ‚Äî part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons ‚Äî with far reaching implications for society.‚Äô [89] Rifkin envisages: ‚ÄòMillions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to 83 Don Tapscott, and Anthony Williams, *MacroWikinomics: New Solutions for a Connected Planet*, London: Atlantic Books, 2010. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Jeremy Rifkin, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of things, The Collaborative Commons,* *and the Eclipse of Capitalism*, New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2014. 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid. 24 ----- ## the global Collaborative Commons.‚Äô [90] He observes: ‚ÄòProsumers are plugging into the fledgling Internet of Things (IoT) and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost.‚Äô [91] Rifkin‚Äôs thesis is that monopoly capitalism will be displayed by a collaborative commons. [92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: ‚ÄòIf ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.‚Äô [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

He is wearing a black leather jacket. The words "TIME" and "100" are prominently displayed with accompanying text. The announcement by Tesla Motors also promoted a wider discussion about economics, business, and innovation in respect of the automobile industry. Professor Joshua Gans, an economist from the University of Toronto, commented, ‚ÄòIt is 448 words that I believe (despite its length) may well become the Gettysburg Address for entrepreneurship and innovation.‚Äô [94] In his address, Elon Musk emphasized: ‚ÄòTechnology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world‚Äôs most 94 Joshua Gans, ‚ÄòIntellectual Property Strategy as Public Relations‚Äô, Digitopoly, 12 June 2014, http://www.digitopoly.org/2014/06/12/intellectual -\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_12]\\\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\\'text\\\', text=\\\'used for transportation and grid storage. Electric vehicles can be charged at work and become a source as well as a user of energy for the home. The result will be a swift transition from liquid-energy transportation to electric transportation. [109] ## Seba admits that ‚Äòan electric vehicle is still more expensive to purchase upfront, mainly due to battery costs‚Äô. [110] He predicts that ‚Äòlike other technology products, the technology cost curve of electric vehicles points to a disruption soon; innovative business models will only accelerate the transition from gasoline to electric vehicles.‚Äô [111] It is certainly notable that Elon Musk has investments in both electric cars and solar energy. The entrepreneur obviously sees synergies in respect of his ventures. 108 Ibid., 9. 109 Ibid. 9. 110 Ibid., 8. 111 Ibid., 8. 30 ----- ## Silicon Valley entrepreneur Aaron Levie, the CEO of Box Inc observed: ‚ÄòBy opening its patents, Tesla rightly realises it‚Äôs better to be the best product in a large industry than the only product in a niche one.‚Äô [112] Tesla Motors has been in discussions with BMW about standardizing electric cars. A BMW spokesman said: ‚ÄòBoth companies are strongly committed to the success of electro-mobility and discussed how to further strengthen the development of electro-mobility on an international level.‚Äô [113] There has been speculation about the development of a long-term deal between the two companies. [114] Writing in Slate, Will Oremus considered the announcement of Tesla Motors from a business perspective. He recognised: ‚ÄòThis might seem like a rash move for a company that still faces big hurdles on its path to long-term, mainstream success.‚Äô [115] Oremus anticipated a polarised 112 Associated Press, ‚ÄòTesla Hands Over the Keys to its Electric Car Technology‚Äô, *The Guardian*, 14 June 2014, http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/13/tesla - elon - musk - electric - cars - patent technology?CMP = twt _ gu 113 Edward Taylor, ‚ÄòBMW and Tesla Executives Meet to Discuss Electric Cars‚Äô, *Business Insider*, Reuters, 13 June 2014, http://www.businessinsider.com/r - bmw - and - tesla - executives - meet - to - discuss - electric - cars - 2014 13?IR = T 114 Neil Winton, ‚ÄòTesla Giveaway Spurs Speculation of Possible Deal with BMW‚Äô, *Forbes*, 13 June 2014, http://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2014/06/13/tesla - patent - giveaway - spurs - speculation - of - possible - deal with - bmw/ 115 Will Oremus, ‚ÄòTesla is Opening Its Patents to All.

Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country\'s currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country\'s ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4] Comparisons of national wealth are also frequently made based on purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.[5] The rankings of national economies over time have changed considerably; the economy of the United States surpassed the British Empire\'s output around 1916,[6] which in turn had surpassed the economy of the Qing dynasty in aggregate output decades earlier.[7][8] Since China\'s transition to a socialist market economy through controlled privatisation and deregulation,[9][10] the country has seen its ranking increase from ninth in 1978, to second in 2010; China\'s economic growth accelerated during this period and its share of global nominal GDP surged from 2% in 1980 to 18% in 2021.[8][1][11] The first list includes estimates compiled by the International Monetary Fund\'s World Economic Outlook, the second list shows the World Bank\'s data, and the third list includes data compiled by the United Nations Statistics Division. The IMF\'s definitive data for the past year and estimates for the current year are published twice a year in April and October.

Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country\'s currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country\'s ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4]\\n\\nComparisons of national wealth are also frequently made based on purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.[5]\\n\\nThe rankings of national economies over time have changed considerably; the economy of the United States surpassed the British Empire\'s output around 1916,[6] which in turn had surpassed the economy of the Qing dynasty in aggregate output decades earlier.[7][8] Since China\'s transition to a socialist market economy through controlled privatisation and deregulation,[9][10] the country has seen its ranking increase from ninth in 1978, to second in 2010; China\'s economic growth accelerated during this period and its share of global nominal GDP surged from 2% in 1980 to 18% in 2021.[8][1][11]\\n\\nThe first list includes estimates compiled by the International Monetary Fund\'s World Economic Outlook, the second list shows the World Bank\'s data, and the third list includes data compiled by the United Nations Statistics Division. The IMF\'s definitive data for the past year and estimates for the current year are published twice a year in April and October. Non-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition (such as Kosovo and Taiwan) are included in the list where they appear

    # PLAN:
    """
    Pattern: Sequential Dependency
    Steps:
    1. Use duckduckgo_search_results to find a reliable source for the GDP of the top 5 countries.
    2. Extract the URLs of the search results.
    3. Use convert_webpage_url_into_markdown to get the content of the most promising URL.
    4. Extract the GDP values of the top 5 countries from the markdown content.
    5. Use the add tool to calculate the total GDP of the top 5 countries.
    6. Return the final answer.

    Error Handling:
    If convert_webpage_url_into_markdown fails, try the next URL from search results.
    If extracting GDP values from markdown fails, try a different search query.
    If add tool fails, retry with slightly different input format (e.g., converting numbers to strings).

    Lifeline Handling:
    If running out of lifelines, use cached search results to get the GDP values and calculate the total.

Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country\'s currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country\'s ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4]\\n\\nComparisons of national wealth are also frequently made based on purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.[5]\\n\\nThe rankings of national economies over time have changed considerably; the economy of the United States surpassed the British Empire\'s output around 1916,[6] which in turn had surpassed the economy of the Qing dynasty in aggregate output decades earlier.[7][8] Since China\'s transition to a socialist market economy through controlled privatisation and deregulation,[9][10] the country has seen its ranking increase from ninth in 1978, to second in 2010; China\'s economic growth accelerated during this period and its share of global nominal GDP surged from 2% in 1980 to 18% in 2021.[8][1][11]\\n\\nThe first list includes estimates compiled by the International Monetary Fund\'s World Economic Outlook, the second list shows the World Bank\'s data, and the third list includes data compiled by the United Nations Statistics Division. The IMF\'s definitive data for the past year and estimates for the current year are published twice a year in April and October. Non-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition (such as Kosovo and Taiwan) are included in the list where they appear in the sources.\\n\\n## Table\\n\\n*The table initially ranks each IMF member including sovereign states not part of the IMF, non-sovereign nations and territories, and countries with limited

Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country\'s currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country\'s ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4]\\n\\nComparisons of national wealth are also frequently made based on purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.[5]\\n\\nThe rankings of national economies over time have changed considerably; the economy of the United States surpassed the British Empire\'s output around 1916,[6] which in turn had surpassed the economy of the Qing dynasty in aggregate output decades earlier.[7][8] Since China\'s transition to a socialist market economy through controlled privatisation and deregulation,[9][10] the country has seen its ranking increase from ninth in 1978, to second in 2010; China\'s economic growth accelerated during this period and its share of global nominal GDP surged from 2% in 1980 to 18% in 2021.[8][1][11]\\n\\nThe first list includes estimates compiled by the International Monetary Fund\'s World Economic Outlook, the second list shows the World Bank\'s data, and the third list includes data compiled by the United Nations Statistics Division. The IMF\'s definitive data for the past year and estimates for the current year are published twice a year in April and October. Non-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition (such as Kosovo and Taiwan) are included in the list where they appear in the sources.\\n\\n## Table\\n\\n*The table initially ranks each IMF member including sovereign states not part of the IMF, non-sovereign nations and territories, and countries with limited

Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country\'s currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country\'s ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4]\\n\\nComparisons of national wealth are also frequently made based on purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.[5]\\n\\nThe rankings of national economies over time have changed considerably; the economy of the United States surpassed the British Empire\'s output around 1916,[6] which in turn had surpassed the economy of the Qing dynasty in aggregate output decades earlier.[7][8] Since China\'s transition to a socialist market economy through controlled privatisation and deregulation,[9][10] the country has seen its ranking increase from ninth in 1978, to second in 2010; China\'s economic growth accelerated during this period and its share of global nominal GDP surged from 2% in 1980 to 18% in 2021.[8][1][11]\\n\\nThe first list includes estimates compiled by the International Monetary Fund\'s World Economic Outlook, the second list shows the World Bank\'s data, and the third list includes data compiled by the United Nations Statistics Division. The IMF\'s definitive data for the past year and estimates for the current year are published twice a year in April and October. Non-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition (such as Kosovo and Taiwan) are included in the list where they appear in the sources.\\n\\n## Table\\n\\n*The table initially ranks each IMF member including sovereign states not part of the IMF, non-sovereign nations and territories, and countries with limited

Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country\'s currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country\'s ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4]\\n\\nComparisons of national wealth are also frequently made based on purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.[5]\\n\\nThe rankings of national economies over time have changed considerably; the economy of the United States surpassed the British Empire\'s output around 1916,[6] which in turn had surpassed the economy of the Qing dynasty in aggregate output decades earlier.[7][8] Since China\'s transition to a socialist market economy through controlled privatisation and deregulation,[9][10] the country has seen its ranking increase from ninth in 1978, to second in 2010; China\'s economic growth accelerated during this period and its share of global nominal GDP surged from 2% in 1980 to 18% in 2021.[8][1][11]\\n\\nThe first list includes estimates compiled by the International Monetary Fund\'s World Economic Outlook, the second list shows the World Bank\'s data, and the third list includes data compiled by the United Nations Statistics Division. The IMF\'s definitive data for the past year and estimates for the current year are published twice a year in April and October. Non-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition (such as Kosovo and Taiwan) are included in the list where they appear

Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country\'s currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country\'s ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4]\\n\\nComparisons of national wealth are also frequently made based on purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.[5]\\n\\nThe rankings of national economies over time have changed considerably; the economy of the United States surpassed the British Empire\'s output around 1916,[6] which in turn had surpassed the economy of the Qing dynasty in aggregate output decades earlier.[7][8] Since China\'s transition to a socialist market economy through controlled privatisation and deregulation,[9][10] the country has seen its ranking increase from ninth in 1978, to second in 2010; China\'s economic growth accelerated during this period and its share of global nominal GDP surged from 2% in 1980 to 18% in 2021.[8][1][11]\\n\\nThe first list includes estimates compiled by the International Monetary Fund\'s World Economic Outlook, the second list shows the World Bank\'s data, and the third list includes data compiled by the United Nations Statistics Division. The IMF\'s definitive data for the past year and estimates for the current year are published twice a year in April and October. Non-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition (such as Kosovo and Taiwan) are included in the list where they appear

Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country\\\'s currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country\\\'s ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4]\\\\n\\\\nComparisons of national wealth are also frequently made based on purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.[5]\\\\n\\\\nThe rankings of national economies over time have changed considerably; the economy of the United States surpassed the British Empire\\\'s output around 1916,[6] which in turn had surpassed the economy of the Qing dynasty in aggregate output decades earlier.[7][8] Since China\\\'s transition to a socialist market economy through controlled privatisation and deregulation,[9][10] the country has seen its ranking increase from ninth in 1978, to second in 2010; China\\\'s economic growth accelerated during this period and its share of global nominal GDP surged from 2% in 1980 to 18% in 2021.[8][1][11]\\\\n\\\\nThe first list includes estimates compiled by the International Monetary Fund\\\'s World Economic Outlook, the second list shows the World Bank\\\'s data, and the third list includes data compiled by the United Nations Statistics Division. The IMF\\\'s definitive data for the past year and estimates for the current year are published twice a year in April and October. Non-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition (such as Kosovo and Taiwan) are included in the list where they appear in the sources.\\\\n\\\\n## Table\\\\n\\\\n*The table initially ranks each IMF member including sovereign states not part of the IMF, non-sovereign nations and territories, and countries with limited
