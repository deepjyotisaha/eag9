In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: ‚ÄòOur roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 ----- ## software engineering‚Äô. [3] The company observes: ‚ÄòWe believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.‚Äô [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors‚Äô biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X.\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle 8 ----- performance under demanding real-life driving conditions. These technology innovations have resulted in an extensive intellectual property portfolio‚Äîas of December 31, 2012, we had 117 issued patents and more than 258 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas. [ 22] ## The company stressed: ‚ÄòOur design and vehicle engineering capabilities, combined with the technical advancements of our powertrain system, have enabled us to design and develop zero tailpipe emission vehicles that we believe overcome the design, styling, and performance issues that we believe have historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles‚Äô. [23] Tesla Motors insisted that its comparative advantages included long range and recharging flexibility; energy efficiency and cost of ownership; and high performance without compromised design or functionality. Assessing its intellectual property portfolio, Tesla Motors stressed in 2012: Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. As of December 31, 2012, we had 117 issued patents and more than 258 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas. Our issued patents start expiring in 2026. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to 22 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 23 Ibid. 9 ----- narrow our claims. Even if granted, there can be no assurance that these pending patent applications will provide us with protection. [ 24] ## This approach certainly seems to be one that is focused the protection of intellectual property through patent law, and a combination of other supplementary forms of intellectual property. Maulin Shah has provided a useful analysis of the patent portfolio of Tesla Motors in terms of infographics. [25] Shah comments: 120 of Tesla‚Äôs patents are related to battery and charging technologies, and not surprisingly, this technology makes up the vast majority of its patent portfolio. Tesla also owns 20 patents related to electric motor and drive control, 10 patents on vehicle frames and chassis, followed by a handful of patents related to doors/latches, air conditioning technology, sunroofs (note the signature panoramic roofs of the Model S), and user interfaces/displays. [26] ## Shah notes the competition in the area: ‚ÄòHowever, while Tesla may not have much competition in the commercial marketplace for purely electric vehicles, automotive giants such as General Motors, Toyota, Honda, Ford, Nissan, and Daimler have all amassed significant patent portfolios related to electric vehicle technology.‚Äô [27] 24\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_4]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='to our way of life.‚Äô [85] The pair concluded: ‚ÄòWe need to take the sum of mankind‚Äôs knowledge about sustainable technologies and industries, and share it for the sake of the planet and the future generations that will inhabit it.‚Äô [86] Similarly, the futurist Jeremy Rifkin considers the rise of collaborative commons in his recent book, The Zero Marginal Cost Society. [87] He has observed that ‚Äòa powerful new technology revolution is emerging that is going to fundamentally alter our economic life.‚Äô [88] Rifkin predicts: ‚ÄòThe plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy ‚Äî part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons ‚Äî with far reaching implications for society.‚Äô [89] Rifkin envisages: ‚ÄòMillions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to 83 Don Tapscott, and Anthony Williams, *MacroWikinomics: New Solutions for a Connected Planet*, London: Atlantic Books, 2010. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Jeremy Rifkin, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of things, The Collaborative Commons,* *and the Eclipse of Capitalism*, New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2014. 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid. 24 ----- ## the global Collaborative Commons.‚Äô [90] He observes: ‚ÄòProsumers are plugging into the fledgling Internet of Things (IoT) and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost.‚Äô [91] Rifkin‚Äôs thesis is that monopoly capitalism will be displayed by a collaborative commons. [92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: ‚ÄòIf ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.‚Äô [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

The announcement by Tesla Motors also promoted a wider discussion about economics, business, and innovation in respect of the automobile industry. Professor Joshua Gans, an economist from the University of Toronto, commented, ‚ÄòIt is 448 words that I believe (despite its length) may well become the Gettysburg Address for entrepreneurship and innovation.‚Äô [94] In his address, Elon Musk emphasized: ‚ÄòTechnology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world‚Äôs most 94 Joshua Gans, ‚ÄòIntellectual Property Strategy as Public Relations‚Äô, Digitopoly, 12 June 2014, http://www.digitopoly.org/2014/06/12/intellectual -\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_12]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='property - strategy - as - pr/ 26 ----- ## talented engineers.‚Äô [95] He hopes that his open source stratagem will enable him to compete with the big automobile manufacturers. [96] Elon Musk has long desired to turn Tesla into the car company of the future. [97] In its annual report, Tesla Motors identifies a wide range of risks and challenges in terms of its business model. [98] Elon Musk‚Äôs embrace of an open source philosophy will also be powerful in terms of marketing and public relations ‚Äî both within the industry, and with the wider community. Associated Press noted: ‚ÄòThe open-source movement has long appealed to the egalitarian mindset of most technologists, so the patent decision could help recruit talent.‚Äô [99] 95 Elon Musk, ‚ÄòAll Our Patents Belong to You‚Äô, Tesla Motors, 12 June 2014, http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all - our - patent - are - belong - you 96 Pat McGrath, ‚ÄòElectric Car Maker Opens Access to Patents in Effort to Take on Big Manufacturers‚Äô, *The World Today*, 13 June 2014, http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2014/s4024647.htm 97 Joshua Davis, ‚ÄòHow Elon Musk Turned Tesla into the Car Company of the Future‚Äô, *Wired*, 27 September 2010, http://www.wired.com/2010/09/ff _ tesla/ 98 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 99 Associated Press, ‚ÄòTesla Hands Over the Keys to its Electric Car Technology‚Äô, *The Guardian*, 14 June 2014, http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/13/tesla - elon - musk - electric - cars - patent technology?CMP = twt _ gu 27 ----- ## In his book Clean Disruption of Energy and Transportation, Tony Seba has considered the electric vehicle as a disruptive technology. [100] He was enthusiastic about the rise of Tesla Motors, and its rapid growth in the automobile marketplace: Tesla fashions itself a Silicon Valley computer company, closer in spirit and thinking to Apple and Google than to its Detroit forebears. Elon Musk, Tesla‚Äôs CEO, did not deny the possibility of his own company being acquired by a ‚Äúdeep pockets‚Äù company like Apple. Prizes are one thing, but when the rubber hits the proverbial road, unit sales are what matter in the auto industry. When market figures for the second quarter of 2013 were released, Tesla had outsold Mercedes Benz, BMW, and Audi in the ‚Äúlarge luxury‚Äù category, according to Green Car reports. [101] ## Seba maintained that ‚Äòthe electric vehicle will disrupt the gasoline car industry (and with it the oil industry) swiftly and permanently.‚Äô [102] He observed that ‚Äòeven worse from the standpoint of gasoline and diesel cars, the EV is not just a disruptive technology; the whole business model that the auto industry has built over the past century will be obliterated.‚Äô [103] Seba suggested that there are nine reasons why the electric vehicle industry will be disruptive. He noted that the electric motor is more energy efficient; the electric vehicle is cheaper to charge; and it is cheaper to maintain. Seba noted that the electric vehicle will disrupt the gasoline car aftermarket. He wondered about the potential for wireless charging. 100 Tony Seba, *Clean Disruption of Energy\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_13]', annotations=None)] isError=False

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô.

[23] Tesla Motors insisted that its comparative advantages included long range and recharging flexibility; energy efficiency and cost of ownership; and high performance without compromised design or functionality. Assessing its intellectual property portfolio, Tesla Motors stressed in 2012: Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. As of December 31, 2012, we had 117 issued patents and more than 258 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas.

[ 24] ## This approach certainly seems to be one that is focused the protection of intellectual property through patent law, and a combination of other supplementary forms of intellectual property. Maulin Shah has provided a useful analysis of the patent portfolio of Tesla Motors in terms of infographics. [25] Shah comments: 120 of Tesla‚Äôs patents are related to battery and charging technologies, and not surprisingly, this technology makes up the vast majority of its patent portfolio. Tesla also owns 20 patents related to electric motor and drive control, 10 patents on vehicle frames and chassis, followed by a handful of patents related to doors/latches, air conditioning technology, sunroofs (note the signature panoramic roofs of the Model S), and user interfaces/displays. [26] ## Shah notes the competition in the area: ‚ÄòHowever, while Tesla may not have much competition in the commercial marketplace for purely electric vehicles, automotive giants such as General Motors, Toyota, Honda, Ford, Nissan, and Daimler have all amassed significant patent portfolios related to electric vehicle technology.‚Äô [27] 24\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_4]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='to our way of life.‚Äô [85] The pair concluded: ‚ÄòWe need to take the sum of mankind‚Äôs knowledge about sustainable technologies and industries, and share it for the sake of the planet and the future generations that will inhabit it.‚Äô [86] Similarly, the futurist Jeremy Rifkin considers the rise of collaborative commons in his recent book, The Zero Marginal Cost Society.

Elon Musk, Tesla‚Äôs CEO, did not deny the possibility of his own company being acquired by a ‚Äúdeep pockets‚Äù company like Apple. Prizes are one thing, but when the rubber hits the proverbial road, unit sales are what matter in the auto industry. When market figures for the second quarter of 2013 were released, Tesla had outsold Mercedes Benz, BMW, and Audi in the ‚Äúlarge luxury‚Äù category, according to Green Car reports. [101] ## Seba maintained that ‚Äòthe electric vehicle will disrupt the gasoline car industry (and with it the oil industry) swiftly and permanently.‚Äô [102] He observed that ‚Äòeven worse from the standpoint of gasoline and diesel cars, the EV is not just a disruptive technology; the whole business model that the auto industry has built over the past century will be obliterated.‚Äô [103] Seba suggested that there are nine reasons why the electric vehicle industry will be disruptive. He noted that the electric motor is more energy efficient; the electric vehicle is cheaper to charge; and it is cheaper to maintain. Seba noted that the electric vehicle will disrupt the gasoline car aftermarket. He wondered about the potential for wireless charging. 100 Tony Seba, *Clean Disruption of Energy\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_13]', annotations=None)] isError=False

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: ‚ÄòOur roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 ----- ## software engineering‚Äô. [3] The company observes: ‚ÄòWe believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.‚Äô [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors‚Äô biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X.\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle 8 ----- performance under demanding real-life driving conditions. These technology innovations have resulted in an extensive intellectual property portfolio‚Äîas of December 31, 2012, we had 117 issued patents and more than 258 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas. [ 22] ## The company stressed: ‚ÄòOur design and vehicle engineering capabilities, combined with the technical advancements of our powertrain system, have enabled us to design and develop zero tailpipe emission vehicles that we believe overcome the design, styling, and performance issues that we believe have historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles‚Äô. [23] Tesla Motors insisted that its comparative advantages included long range and recharging flexibility; energy efficiency and cost of ownership; and high performance without compromised design or functionality. Assessing its intellectual property portfolio, Tesla Motors stressed in 2012: Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. As of December 31, 2012, we had 117 issued patents and more than 258 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas. Our issued patents start expiring in 2026. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to 22 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 23 Ibid. 9 ----- narrow our claims. Even if granted, there can be no assurance that these pending patent applications will provide us with protection. [ 24] ## This approach certainly seems to be one that is focused the protection of intellectual property through patent law, and a combination of other supplementary forms of intellectual property. Maulin Shah has provided a useful analysis of the patent portfolio of Tesla Motors in terms of infographics. [25] Shah comments: 120 of Tesla‚Äôs patents are related to battery and charging technologies, and not surprisingly, this technology makes up the vast majority of its patent portfolio. Tesla also owns 20 patents related to electric motor and drive control, 10 patents on vehicle frames and chassis, followed by a handful of patents related to doors/latches, air conditioning technology, sunroofs (note the signature panoramic roofs of the Model S), and user interfaces/displays. [26] ## Shah notes the competition in the area: ‚ÄòHowever, while Tesla may not have much competition in the commercial marketplace for purely electric vehicles, automotive giants such as General Motors, Toyota, Honda, Ford, Nissan, and Daimler have all amassed significant patent portfolios related to electric vehicle technology.‚Äô [27] 24\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_4]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='to our way of life.‚Äô [85] The pair concluded: ‚ÄòWe need to take the sum of mankind‚Äôs knowledge about sustainable technologies and industries, and share it for the sake of the planet and the future generations that will inhabit it.‚Äô [86] Similarly, the futurist Jeremy Rifkin considers the rise of collaborative commons in his recent book, The Zero Marginal Cost Society. [87] He has observed that ‚Äòa powerful new technology revolution is emerging that is going to fundamentally alter our economic life.‚Äô [88] Rifkin predicts: ‚ÄòThe plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy ‚Äî part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons ‚Äî with far reaching implications for society.‚Äô [89] Rifkin envisages: ‚ÄòMillions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to 83 Don Tapscott, and Anthony Williams, *MacroWikinomics: New Solutions for a Connected Planet*, London: Atlantic Books, 2010. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Jeremy Rifkin, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of things, The Collaborative Commons,* *and the Eclipse of Capitalism*, New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2014. 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid. 24 ----- ## the global Collaborative Commons.‚Äô [90] He observes: ‚ÄòProsumers are plugging into the fledgling Internet of Things (IoT) and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost.‚Äô [91] Rifkin‚Äôs thesis is that monopoly capitalism will be displayed by a collaborative commons. [92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: ‚ÄòIf ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.‚Äô [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

The announcement by Tesla Motors also promoted a wider discussion about economics, business, and innovation in respect of the automobile industry. Professor Joshua Gans, an economist from the University of Toronto, commented, ‚ÄòIt is 448 words that I believe (despite its length) may well become the Gettysburg Address for entrepreneurship and innovation.‚Äô [94] In his address, Elon Musk emphasized: ‚ÄòTechnology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world‚Äôs most 94 Joshua Gans, ‚ÄòIntellectual Property Strategy as Public Relations‚Äô, Digitopoly, 12 June 2014, http://www.digitopoly.org/2014/06/12/intellectual -\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_12]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='property - strategy - as - pr/ 26 ----- ## talented engineers.‚Äô [95] He hopes that his open source stratagem will enable him to compete with the big automobile manufacturers. [96] Elon Musk has long desired to turn Tesla into the car company of the future. [97] In its annual report, Tesla Motors identifies a wide range of risks and challenges in terms of its business model. [98] Elon Musk‚Äôs embrace of an open source philosophy will also be powerful in terms of marketing and public relations ‚Äî both within the industry, and with the wider community. Associated Press noted: ‚ÄòThe open-source movement has long appealed to the egalitarian mindset of most technologists, so the patent decision could help recruit talent.‚Äô [99] 95 Elon Musk, ‚ÄòAll Our Patents Belong to You‚Äô, Tesla Motors, 12 June 2014, http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all - our - patent - are - belong - you 96 Pat McGrath, ‚ÄòElectric Car Maker Opens Access to Patents in Effort to Take on Big Manufacturers‚Äô, *The World Today*, 13 June 2014, http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2014/s4024647.htm 97 Joshua Davis, ‚ÄòHow Elon Musk Turned Tesla into the Car Company of the Future‚Äô, *Wired*, 27 September 2010, http://www.wired.com/2010/09/ff _ tesla/ 98 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 99 Associated Press, ‚ÄòTesla Hands Over the Keys to its Electric Car Technology‚Äô, *The Guardian*, 14 June 2014, http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/13/tesla - elon - musk - electric - cars - patent technology?CMP = twt _ gu 27 ----- ## In his book Clean Disruption of Energy and Transportation, Tony Seba has considered the electric vehicle as a disruptive technology. [100] He was enthusiastic about the rise of Tesla Motors, and its rapid growth in the automobile marketplace: Tesla fashions itself a Silicon Valley computer company, closer in spirit and thinking to Apple and Google than to its Detroit forebears. Elon Musk, Tesla‚Äôs CEO, did not deny the possibility of his own company being acquired by a ‚Äúdeep pockets‚Äù company like Apple. Prizes are one thing, but when the rubber hits the proverbial road, unit sales are what matter in the auto industry. When market figures for the second quarter of 2013 were released, Tesla had outsold Mercedes Benz, BMW, and Audi in the ‚Äúlarge luxury‚Äù category, according to Green Car reports.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: ‚ÄòOur roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 ----- ## software engineering‚Äô. [3] The company observes: ‚ÄòWe believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.‚Äô [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors‚Äô biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X.\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0]\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\'text\', text=\'and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle 8 ----- performance under demanding real-life driving conditions. These technology innovations have resulted in an extensive intellectual property portfolio‚Äîas of December 31, 2012, we had 117 issued patents and more than 258 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas. [ 22] ## The company stressed: ‚ÄòOur design and vehicle engineering capabilities, combined with the technical advancements of our powertrain system, have enabled us to design and develop zero tailpipe emission vehicles that we believe overcome the design, styling, and performance issues that we believe have historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles‚Äô. [23] Tesla Motors insisted that its comparative advantages included long range and recharging flexibility; energy efficiency and cost of ownership; and high performance without compromised design or functionality. Assessing its intellectual property portfolio, Tesla Motors stressed in 2012: Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. As of December 31, 2012, we had 117 issued patents and more than 258 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas. Our issued patents start expiring in 2026. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to 22 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 23 Ibid. 9 ----- narrow our claims. Even if granted, there can be no assurance that these pending patent applications will provide us with protection. [ 24] ## This approach certainly seems to be one that is focused the protection of intellectual property through patent law, and a combination of other supplementary forms of intellectual property. Maulin Shah has provided a useful analysis of the patent portfolio of Tesla Motors in terms of infographics. [25] Shah comments: 120 of Tesla‚Äôs patents are related to battery and charging technologies, and not surprisingly, this technology makes up the vast majority of its patent portfolio. Tesla also owns 20 patents related to electric motor and drive control, 10 patents on vehicle frames and chassis, followed by a handful of patents related to doors/latches, air conditioning technology, sunroofs (note the signature panoramic roofs of the Model S), and user interfaces/displays.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: ‚ÄòOur roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 ----- ## software engineering‚Äô. [3] The company observes: ‚ÄòWe believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.‚Äô [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft.

These technology innovations have resulted in an extensive intellectual property portfolio‚Äîas of December 31, 2012, we had 117 issued patents and more than 258 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas. [ 22] ## The company stressed: ‚ÄòOur design and vehicle engineering capabilities, combined with the technical advancements of our powertrain system, have enabled us to design and develop zero tailpipe emission vehicles that we believe overcome the design, styling, and performance issues that we believe have historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles‚Äô. [23] Tesla Motors insisted that its comparative advantages included long range and recharging flexibility; energy efficiency and cost of ownership; and high performance without compromised design or functionality. Assessing its intellectual property portfolio, Tesla Motors stressed in 2012: Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. As of December 31, 2012, we had 117 issued patents and more than 258 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas. Our issued patents start expiring in 2026. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to 22 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 23 Ibid. 9 ----- narrow our claims. Even if granted, there can be no assurance that these pending patent applications will provide us with protection. [ 24] ## This approach certainly seems to be one that is focused the protection of intellectual property through patent law, and a combination of other supplementary forms of intellectual property. Maulin Shah has provided a useful analysis of the patent portfolio of Tesla Motors in terms of infographics. [25] Shah comments: 120 of Tesla‚Äôs patents are related to battery and charging technologies, and not surprisingly, this technology makes up the vast majority of its patent portfolio. Tesla also owns 20 patents related to electric motor and drive control, 10 patents on vehicle frames and chassis, followed by a handful of patents related to doors/latches, air conditioning technology, sunroofs (note the signature panoramic roofs of the Model S), and user interfaces/displays. [26] ## Shah notes the competition in the area: ‚ÄòHowever, while Tesla may not have much competition in the commercial marketplace for purely electric vehicles, automotive giants such as General Motors, Toyota, Honda, Ford, Nissan, and Daimler have all amassed significant patent portfolios related to electric vehicle technology.‚Äô [27] 24\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_4]\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\'text\', text=\'to our way of life.‚Äô [85] The pair concluded: ‚ÄòWe need to take the sum of mankind‚Äôs knowledge about sustainable technologies and industries, and share it for the sake of the planet and the future generations that will inhabit it.‚Äô [86] Similarly, the futurist Jeremy Rifkin considers the rise of collaborative commons in his recent book, The Zero Marginal Cost Society. [87] He has observed that ‚Äòa powerful new technology revolution is emerging that is going to fundamentally alter our economic life.‚Äô [88] Rifkin predicts: ‚ÄòThe plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy ‚Äî part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons ‚Äî with far reaching implications for society.‚Äô [89] Rifkin envisages: ‚ÄòMillions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to 83 Don Tapscott, and Anthony Williams, *MacroWikinomics: New Solutions for a Connected Planet*, London: Atlantic Books, 2010. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Jeremy Rifkin, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of things, The Collaborative Commons,* *and the Eclipse of Capitalism*, New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2014. 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid. 24 ----- ## the global Collaborative Commons.‚Äô [90] He observes: ‚ÄòProsumers are plugging into the fledgling Internet of Things (IoT) and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost.‚Äô [91] Rifkin‚Äôs thesis is that monopoly capitalism will be displayed by a collaborative commons. [92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: ‚ÄòIf ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.‚Äô [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

The announcement by Tesla Motors also promoted a wider discussion about economics, business, and innovation in respect of the automobile industry. Professor Joshua Gans, an economist from the University of Toronto, commented, ‚ÄòIt is 448 words that I believe (despite its length) may well become the Gettysburg Address for entrepreneurship and innovation.‚Äô [94] In his address, Elon Musk emphasized: ‚ÄòTechnology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world‚Äôs most 94 Joshua Gans, ‚ÄòIntellectual Property Strategy as Public Relations‚Äô, Digitopoly, 12 June 2014, http://www.digitopoly.org/2014/06/12/intellectual -\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_12]\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\'text\', text=\'property - strategy - as - pr/ 26 ----- ## talented engineers.‚Äô [95] He hopes that his open source stratagem will enable him to compete with the big automobile manufacturers. [96] Elon Musk has long desired to turn Tesla into the car company of the future. [97] In its annual report, Tesla Motors identifies a wide range of risks and challenges in terms of its business model. [98] Elon Musk‚Äôs embrace of an open source philosophy will also be powerful in terms of marketing and public relations ‚Äî both within the industry, and with the wider community. Associated Press noted: ‚ÄòThe open-source movement has long appealed to the egalitarian mindset of most technologists, so the patent decision could help recruit talent.‚Äô [99] 95 Elon Musk, ‚ÄòAll Our Patents Belong to You‚Äô, Tesla Motors, 12 June 2014, http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all - our - patent - are - belong - you 96 Pat McGrath, ‚ÄòElectric Car Maker Opens Access to Patents in Effort to Take on Big Manufacturers‚Äô, *The World Today*, 13 June 2014, http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2014/s4024647.htm 97 Joshua Davis, ‚ÄòHow Elon Musk Turned Tesla into the Car Company of the Future‚Äô, *Wired*, 27 September 2010, http://www.wired.com/2010/09/ff _ tesla/ 98 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 99 Associated Press, ‚ÄòTesla Hands Over the Keys to its Electric Car Technology‚Äô, *The Guardian*, 14 June 2014, http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/13/tesla - elon - musk - electric - cars - patent technology?CMP = twt _ gu 27 ----- ## In his book Clean Disruption of Energy and Transportation, Tony Seba has considered the electric vehicle as a disruptive technology. [100] He was enthusiastic about the rise of Tesla Motors, and its rapid growth in the automobile marketplace: Tesla fashions itself a Silicon Valley computer company, closer in spirit and thinking to Apple and Google than to its Detroit forebears. Elon Musk, Tesla‚Äôs CEO, did not deny the possibility of his own company being acquired by a ‚Äúdeep pockets‚Äù company like Apple. Prizes are one thing, but when the rubber hits the proverbial road, unit sales are what matter in the auto industry. When market figures for the second quarter of 2013 were released, Tesla had outsold Mercedes Benz, BMW, and Audi in the ‚Äúlarge luxury‚Äù category, according to Green Car reports. [101] ## Seba maintained that ‚Äòthe electric vehicle will disrupt the gasoline car industry (and with it the oil industry) swiftly and permanently.‚Äô [102] He observed that ‚Äòeven worse from the standpoint of gasoline and diesel cars, the EV is not just a disruptive technology; the whole business model that the auto industry has built over the past century will be obliterated.‚Äô [103] Seba suggested that there are nine reasons why the electric vehicle industry will be disruptive. He noted that the electric motor is more energy efficient; the electric vehicle is cheaper to charge; and it is cheaper to maintain. Seba noted that the electric vehicle will disrupt the gasoline car aftermarket. He wondered about the potential for wireless charging. 100 Tony Seba, *Clean Disruption of Energy\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_13]\', annotations=None)] isError=False"""

[100] He was enthusiastic about the rise of Tesla Motors, and its rapid growth in the automobile marketplace: Tesla fashions itself a Silicon Valley computer company, closer in spirit and thinking to Apple and Google than to its Detroit forebears. Elon Musk, Tesla‚Äôs CEO, did not deny the possibility of his own company being acquired by a ‚Äúdeep pockets‚Äù company like Apple. Prizes are one thing, but when the rubber hits the proverbial road, unit sales are what matter in the auto industry. When market figures for the second quarter of 2013 were released, Tesla had outsold Mercedes Benz, BMW, and Audi in the ‚Äúlarge luxury‚Äù category, according to Green Car reports. [101] ## Seba maintained that ‚Äòthe electric vehicle will disrupt the gasoline car industry (and with it the oil industry) swiftly and permanently.‚Äô [102] He observed that ‚Äòeven worse from the standpoint of gasoline and diesel cars, the EV is not just a disruptive technology; the whole business model that the auto industry has built over the past century will be obliterated.‚Äô [103] Seba suggested that there are nine reasons why the electric vehicle industry will be disruptive. He noted that the electric motor is more energy efficient; the electric vehicle is cheaper to charge; and it is cheaper to maintain. Seba noted that the electric vehicle will disrupt the gasoline car aftermarket. He wondered about the potential for wireless charging. 100 Tony Seba, *Clean Disruption of Energy\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_13]\', annotations=None)] isError=False"""

In 2012, the company observed: ‚ÄòOur business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.‚Äô [8] Tesla Motors warned: Any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing our vehicles.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: ‚ÄòOur roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 ----- ## software engineering‚Äô. [3] The company observes: ‚ÄòWe believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.‚Äô [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors‚Äô biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X.\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='with regard to patents.‚Äô [61] She observed: ‚ÄòA lot of companies in the high tech space are dismayed with how the system is shaping up, so they‚Äôre trying to come up with creative ways to navigating around that system and get back to the business of innovating and creating.‚Äô [62] The announcement of Tesla Motors may help provide impetus for President Barack Obama‚Äôs efforts to address the problem of patent trolls and reduce patent litigation. Some members of the intellectual property profession have defended the legitimacy of the patent regime in light of Elon Musk‚Äôs comments. Philip Totaro provided a thoughtful riposte. [63] He observed: ‚ÄòWhile this is a noble and well-intentioned move, unfortunately, this thought process represents a widely held misconception about intellectual property: that it is only a legal matter, rather than a commercial one.‚Äô [64] Totaro responded: Patents are not just about hitting the ‚Äòlitigation lottery‚Äô as Mr. Musk put it. Patents are the codification of innovation and they represent the investment of time and effort from the innovative and creative people who have their names on them. Making the investment in intellectual property protection in the first place presumes that you are willing and able to enforce your rights. In any market there will be 61 Julie Samuels quoted in Klint Finley, ‚ÄòWith Patent Giveaway, Tesla shows Silicon Valley What Ingenuity Means‚Äô, *Wired*, 13 June 2014, http://www.wired.com/2014/06/tesla - patents/?mbid = social _ twitter 62 Ibid. 63 Philip Totaro, ‚ÄòIn Defense of IPR: The Timing of the Tesla Move will Diminish the Company‚Äôs Value‚Äô, *Green Patent Blog,* 19 June 2014, http://www.greenpatentblog.com/2014/06/19/in - defense - of - ipr - the timing - of - the - tesla - move - will - diminish - the - company%e2%80%99s - value/ 64 Ibid. 19 ----- those who are driven by greed, and we have seen the exploitation of intellectual property by so-called ‚Äúpatent trolls.‚Äù [65] ## Totaro maintained that one should not be cynical about the intellectual property regime. He wondered whether the move would undercut the value of Tesla Motors. Totaro argued that Musk could do more if he was truly committed to an open source model: ‚ÄòIf Mr. Musk would be willing to redistribute his wealth to the employees and investors who made the commitment to create value for the company in the first place, then this move to open source their patents during the formative stages of the EV industry might make more sense.‚Äô [66] It should also be noted that Tesla Motors has not abandoned its intellectual property entirely. he company has only offered access for ‚Äògood faith‚Äô uses of its patents ‚Äî which still leaves open the prospect of the company taking action against ‚Äòbad faith‚Äô uses of its patents. Professor Orly Lobel from the University of San Diego commented: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a lot of thinking in the research these days on the gap between the codified knowledge that is patentable and gets disclosed versus tacit knowledge that really exists in how you actually produce‚Äô. [67] She noted: ‚ÄòThat gap is probably relevant in this market.‚Äô [68] Her\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_9]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='s /2 0 1 4- 07 - 07/tesla - sued - in - china - for - trademark - infringement.html 159 *Tesla Motors Ltd & Anor* v *British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)* [2013] EWCA Civ 152 (05 March 2013) 160 Ibid. 161 Ibid. 162 Ibid. 41 ----- ## There has also been a conflict over defamation and contract law between Martin Eberhard, one of the founders of Tesla Motors, and its current CEO, Elon Musk.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: ‚ÄòOur roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 ----- ## software engineering‚Äô.

Some members of the intellectual property profession have defended the legitimacy of the patent regime in light of Elon Musk‚Äôs comments. Philip Totaro provided a thoughtful riposte. [63] He observed: ‚ÄòWhile this is a noble and well-intentioned move, unfortunately, this thought process represents a widely held misconception about intellectual property: that it is only a legal matter, rather than a commercial one.‚Äô [64] Totaro responded: Patents are not just about hitting the ‚Äòlitigation lottery‚Äô as Mr. Musk put it. Patents are the codification of innovation and they represent the investment of time and effort from the innovative and creative people who have their names on them. Making the investment in intellectual property protection in the first place presumes that you are willing and able to enforce your rights.

He wondered whether the move would undercut the value of Tesla Motors. Totaro argued that Musk could do more if he was truly committed to an open source model: ‚ÄòIf Mr. Musk would be willing to redistribute his wealth to the employees and investors who made the commitment to create value for the company in the first place, then this move to open source their patents during the formative stages of the EV industry might make more sense.‚Äô [66] It should also be noted that Tesla Motors has not abandoned its intellectual property entirely. he company has only offered access for ‚Äògood faith‚Äô uses of its patents ‚Äî which still leaves open the prospect of the company taking action against ‚Äòbad faith‚Äô uses of its patents. Professor Orly Lobel from the University of San Diego commented: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a lot of thinking in the research these days on the gap between the codified knowledge that is patentable and gets disclosed versus tacit knowledge that really exists in how you actually produce‚Äô. [67] She noted: ‚ÄòThat gap is probably relevant in this market.‚Äô [68] Her\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_9]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='s /2 0 1 4- 07 - 07/tesla - sued - in - china - for - trademark - infringement.html 159 *Tesla Motors Ltd & Anor* v *British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)* [2013] EWCA Civ 152 (05 March 2013) 160 Ibid. 161 Ibid. 162 Ibid. 41 ----- ## There has also been a conflict over defamation and contract law between Martin Eberhard, one of the founders of Tesla Motors, and its current CEO, Elon Musk.

In 2012, the company observed: ‚ÄòOur business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.‚Äô [8] Tesla Motors warned: Any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that ‚Äòthe commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers‚Äô range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles‚Äô. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: ‚ÄòOur roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, ‚ÄòAnnual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012‚Äô, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 ----- ## software engineering‚Äô. [3] The company observes: ‚ÄòWe believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.‚Äô [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors‚Äô biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X.\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='with regard to patents.‚Äô [61] She observed: ‚ÄòA lot of companies in the high tech space are dismayed with how the system is shaping up, so they‚Äôre trying to come up with creative ways to navigating around that system and get back to the business of innovating and creating.‚Äô [62] The announcement of Tesla Motors may help provide impetus for President Barack Obama‚Äôs efforts to address the problem of patent trolls and reduce patent litigation. Some members of the intellectual property profession have defended the legitimacy of the patent regime in light of Elon Musk‚Äôs comments. Philip Totaro provided a thoughtful riposte. [63] He observed: ‚ÄòWhile this is a noble and well-intentioned move, unfortunately, this thought process represents a widely held misconception about intellectual property: that it is only a legal matter, rather than a commercial one.‚Äô [64] Totaro responded: Patents are not just about hitting the ‚Äòlitigation lottery‚Äô as Mr. Musk put it. Patents are the codification of innovation and they represent the investment of time and effort from the innovative and creative people who have their names on them. Making the investment in intellectual property protection in the first place presumes that you are willing and able to enforce your rights. In any market there will be 61 Julie Samuels quoted in Klint Finley, ‚ÄòWith Patent Giveaway, Tesla shows Silicon Valley What Ingenuity Means‚Äô, *Wired*, 13 June 2014, http://www.wired.com/2014/06/tesla - patents/?mbid = social _ twitter 62 Ibid. 63 Philip Totaro, ‚ÄòIn Defense of IPR: The Timing of the Tesla Move will Diminish the Company‚Äôs Value‚Äô, *Green Patent Blog,* 19 June 2014, http://www.greenpatentblog.com/2014/06/19/in - defense - of - ipr - the timing - of - the - tesla - move - will - diminish - the - company%e2%80%99s - value/ 64 Ibid. 19 ----- those who are driven by greed, and we have seen the exploitation of intellectual property by so-called ‚Äúpatent trolls.‚Äù [65] ## Totaro maintained that one should not be cynical about the intellectual property regime. He wondered whether the move would undercut the value of Tesla Motors. Totaro argued that Musk could do more if he was truly committed to an open source model: ‚ÄòIf Mr. Musk would be willing to redistribute his wealth to the employees and investors who made the commitment to create value for the company in the first place, then this move to open source their patents during the formative stages of the EV industry might make more sense.‚Äô [66] It should also be noted that Tesla Motors has not abandoned its intellectual property entirely. he company has only offered access for ‚Äògood faith‚Äô uses of its patents ‚Äî which still leaves open the prospect of the company taking action against ‚Äòbad faith‚Äô uses of its patents. Professor Orly Lobel from the University of San Diego commented: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a lot of thinking in the research these days on the gap between the codified knowledge that is patentable and gets disclosed versus tacit knowledge that really exists in how you actually produce‚Äô. [67] She noted: ‚ÄòThat gap is probably relevant in this market.‚Äô [68] Her\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_9]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='s /2 0 1 4- 07 - 07/tesla - sued - in - china - for - trademark - infringement.html 159 *Tesla Motors Ltd & Anor* v *British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)* [2013] EWCA Civ 152 (05 March 2013) 160 Ibid. 161 Ibid. 162 Ibid. 41 ----- ## There has also been a conflict over defamation and contract law between Martin Eberhard, one of the founders of Tesla Motors, and its current CEO, Elon Musk. [163] Musk has denied that Eberhard was the inventor of Tesla, claiming ‚Äòhe had no technology of his own, he did not have a prototype and he owned no intellectual property relating to electric cars.‚Äô [164] **5. Sustainable Transportation, Clean Technology, and Climate Change ** In his address, Elon Musk emphasized the need to build clean technologies to address the problem of climate change. He observed: ‚ÄòGiven that annual new vehicle production is approaching 100 million per year and the global fleet is approximately 2 billion cars, it is impossible for Tesla to build electric cars fast enough to address the carbon crisis.‚Äô Musk recognised: ‚ÄòBy the same token, it means the market is enormous.‚Äô [ 165] He maintained: ‚ÄòOur true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the world‚Äôs factories every day.‚Äô [166] Musk commented that there was a need to develop the innovation ecology in respect of electric cars: ‚ÄòWe believe that Tesla, other companies making electric cars, and the world would all benefit from a common, rapidly-evolving technology platform.‚Äô [167] 163 Eric Lane, ‚ÄòRoadster Rage: Tesla Founder Sues CEO for Defamation; Alleges Tesla Breached - Contracts‚Äô, *The Green Patent Blog*, 28 June 2009, http://www.greenpatentblog.com/2009/06/28/roadster rage tesla - founder - sues - ceo - for - defamation - alleges - tesla - breached - contracts/ 164 Ucilia Wang, ‚ÄòTesla‚Äôs Elon Musk Rebuts Claims by Martin Eberhard‚Äô, Greentech Media, 22 June 2009, http://www.greentechmedia.com /a rt ic l e s/read/teslas - elon - musk - rebuts - claims - by - martin - eberhard 165 Elon Musk, ‚ÄòAll Our Patents Belong to You‚Äô, Tesla Motors, 12 June 2014, http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all - our - patent - are - belong - you 166 Ibid. 167 Ibid. 42 ----- ## **A. Sustainable Transportation ** The decision to open source electric cars was praised by environmental leaders ‚Äî such as the Sierra Club and the Climate Council in Australia. Jeff Tittel of the New Jersey Sierra Club has maintained: ‚ÄòWe need zero-emission vehicles, which means we also need to educate consumers and inform them about the benefits of owning an electric car.‚Äô [168] Mark Ruffalo ‚Äî the actor famous for playing the Incredible Hulk in the Avengers ‚Äî was also admiring of Elon Musk‚Äôs elan, commenting: ‚ÄòBravo Elon Musk you are a real super hero! So proud to know you. Such a cool thing to do!‚Äô [169] In its 2014 report upon mitigation, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change devoted a chapter to the topic of Transportation.

Electric vehicles can be charged at work and become a source as well as a user of energy for the home. The result will be a swift transition from liquid-energy transportation to electric transportation. [109] ## Seba admits that ‚Äòan electric vehicle is still more expensive to purchase upfront, mainly due to battery costs‚Äô. [110] He predicts that ‚Äòlike other technology products, the technology cost curve of electric vehicles points to a disruption soon; innovative business models will only accelerate the transition from gasoline to electric vehicles.‚Äô [111] It is certainly notable that Elon Musk has investments in both electric cars and solar energy. The entrepreneur obviously sees synergies in respect of his ventures. 108 Ibid., 9. 109 Ibid. 9. 110 Ibid., 8. 111 Ibid., 8. 30 ----- ## Silicon Valley entrepreneur Aaron Levie, the CEO of Box Inc observed: ‚ÄòBy opening its patents, Tesla rightly realises it‚Äôs better to be the best product in a large industry than the only product in a niche one.‚Äô [112] Tesla Motors has been in discussions with BMW about standardizing electric cars. A BMW spokesman said: ‚ÄòBoth companies are strongly committed to the success of electro-mobility and discussed how to further strengthen the development of electro-mobility on an international level.‚Äô [113] There has been speculation about the development of a long-term deal between the two companies. [114] Writing in Slate, Will Oremus considered the announcement of Tesla Motors from a business perspective. He recognised: ‚ÄòThis might seem like a rash move for a company that still faces big hurdles on its path to long-term, mainstream success.‚Äô [115] Oremus anticipated a polarised 112 Associated Press, ‚ÄòTesla Hands Over the Keys to its Electric Car Technology‚Äô, *The Guardian*, 14 June 2014, http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/13/tesla - elon - musk - electric - cars - patent technology?CMP = twt _ gu 113 Edward Taylor, ‚ÄòBMW and Tesla Executives Meet to Discuss Electric Cars‚Äô, *Business Insider*, Reuters, 13 June 2014, http://www.businessinsider.com/r - bmw - and - tesla - executives - meet - to - discuss - electric - cars - 2014 13?IR = T 114 Neil Winton, ‚ÄòTesla Giveaway Spurs Speculation of Possible Deal with BMW‚Äô, *Forbes*, 13 June 2014, http://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2014/06/13/tesla - patent - giveaway - spurs - speculation - of - possible - deal with - bmw/ 115 Will Oremus, ‚ÄòTesla is Opening Its Patents to All.

His Tesla Motors‚Äô biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X.\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0]\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\'text\', text=\'with regard to patents.‚Äô [61] She observed: ‚ÄòA lot of companies in the high tech space are dismayed with how the system is shaping up, so they‚Äôre trying to come up with creative ways to navigating around that system and get back to the business of innovating and creating.‚Äô [62] The announcement of Tesla Motors may help provide impetus for President Barack Obama‚Äôs efforts to address the problem of patent trolls and reduce patent litigation. Some members of the intellectual property profession have defended the legitimacy of the patent regime in light of Elon Musk‚Äôs comments. Philip Totaro provided a thoughtful riposte. [63] He observed: ‚ÄòWhile this is a noble and well-intentioned move, unfortunately, this thought process represents a widely held misconception about intellectual property: that it is only a legal matter, rather than a commercial one.‚Äô [64] Totaro responded: Patents are not just about hitting the ‚Äòlitigation lottery‚Äô as Mr. Musk put it. Patents are the codification of innovation and they represent the investment of time and effort from the innovative and creative people who have their names on them. Making the investment in intellectual property protection in the first place presumes that you are willing and able to enforce your rights. In any market there will be 61 Julie Samuels quoted in Klint Finley, ‚ÄòWith Patent Giveaway, Tesla shows Silicon Valley What Ingenuity Means‚Äô, *Wired*, 13 June 2014, http://www.wired.com/2014/06/tesla - patents/?mbid = social _ twitter 62 Ibid. 63 Philip Totaro, ‚ÄòIn Defense of IPR: The Timing of the Tesla Move will Diminish the Company‚Äôs Value‚Äô, *Green Patent Blog,* 19 June 2014, http://www.greenpatentblog.com/2014/06/19/in - defense - of - ipr - the timing - of - the - tesla - move - will - diminish - the - company%e2%80%99s - value/ 64 Ibid. 19 ----- those who are driven by greed, and we have seen the exploitation of intellectual property by so-called ‚Äúpatent trolls.‚Äù [65] ## Totaro maintained that one should not be cynical about the intellectual property regime. He wondered whether the move would undercut the value of Tesla Motors. Totaro argued that Musk could do more if he was truly committed to an open source model: ‚ÄòIf Mr. Musk would be willing to redistribute his wealth to the employees and investors who made the commitment to create value for the company in the first place, then this move to open source their patents during the formative stages of the EV industry might make more sense.‚Äô [66] It should also be noted that Tesla Motors has not abandoned its intellectual property entirely. he company has only offered access for ‚Äògood faith‚Äô uses of its patents ‚Äî which still leaves open the prospect of the company taking action against ‚Äòbad faith‚Äô uses of its patents. Professor Orly Lobel from the University of San Diego commented: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a lot of thinking in the research these days on the gap between the codified knowledge that is patentable and gets disclosed versus tacit knowledge that really exists in how you actually produce‚Äô. [67] She noted: ‚ÄòThat gap is probably relevant in this market.‚Äô [68] Her\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_9]\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\'text\', text=\'s /2 0 1 4- 07 - 07/tesla - sued - in - china - for - trademark - infringement.html 159 *Tesla Motors Ltd & Anor* v *British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)* [2013] EWCA Civ 152 (05 March 2013) 160 Ibid. 161 Ibid. 162 Ibid. 41 ----- ## There has also been a conflict over defamation and contract law between Martin Eberhard, one of the founders of Tesla Motors, and its current CEO, Elon Musk. [163] Musk has denied that Eberhard was the inventor of Tesla, claiming ‚Äòhe had no technology of his own, he did not have a prototype and he owned no intellectual property relating to electric cars.‚Äô [164] **5. Sustainable Transportation, Clean Technology, and Climate Change ** In his address, Elon Musk emphasized the need to build clean technologies to address the problem of climate change. He observed: ‚ÄòGiven that annual new vehicle production is approaching 100 million per year and the global fleet is approximately 2 billion cars, it is impossible for Tesla to build electric cars fast enough to address the carbon crisis.‚Äô Musk recognised: ‚ÄòBy the same token, it means the market is enormous.‚Äô [ 165] He maintained: ‚ÄòOur true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the world‚Äôs factories every day.‚Äô [166] Musk commented that there was a need to develop the innovation ecology in respect of electric cars: ‚ÄòWe believe that Tesla, other companies making electric cars, and the world would all benefit from a common, rapidly-evolving technology platform.‚Äô [167] 163 Eric Lane, ‚ÄòRoadster Rage: Tesla Founder Sues CEO for Defamation; Alleges Tesla Breached - Contracts‚Äô, *The Green Patent Blog*, 28 June 2009, http://www.greenpatentblog.com/2009/06/28/roadster rage tesla - founder - sues - ceo - for - defamation - alleges - tesla - breached - contracts/ 164 Ucilia Wang, ‚ÄòTesla‚Äôs Elon Musk Rebuts Claims by Martin Eberhard‚Äô, Greentech Media, 22 June 2009, http://www.greentechmedia.com /a rt ic l e s/read/teslas - elon - musk - rebuts - claims - by - martin - eberhard 165 Elon Musk, ‚ÄòAll Our Patents Belong to You‚Äô, Tesla Motors, 12 June 2014, http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all - our - patent - are - belong - you 166 Ibid. 167 Ibid. 42 ----- ## **A. Sustainable Transportation ** The decision to open source electric cars was praised by environmental leaders ‚Äî such as the Sierra Club and the Climate Council in Australia. Jeff Tittel of the New Jersey Sierra Club has maintained: ‚ÄòWe need zero-emission vehicles, which means we also need to educate consumers and inform them about the benefits of owning an electric car.‚Äô [168] Mark Ruffalo ‚Äî the actor famous for playing the Incredible Hulk in the Avengers ‚Äî was also admiring of Elon Musk‚Äôs elan, commenting: ‚ÄòBravo Elon Musk you are a real super hero! So proud to know you. Such a cool thing to do!‚Äô [169] In its 2014 report upon mitigation, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change devoted a chapter to the topic of Transportation. [170] The executive summary noted that ‚ÄòReducing global transport greenhouse\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_22]\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\'text\', text=\'used for transportation and grid storage. Electric vehicles can be charged at work and become a source as well as a user of energy for the home. The result will be a swift transition from liquid-energy transportation to electric transportation. [109] ## Seba admits that ‚Äòan electric vehicle is still more expensive to purchase upfront, mainly due to battery costs‚Äô. [110] He predicts that ‚Äòlike other technology products, the technology cost curve of electric vehicles points to a disruption soon; innovative business models will only accelerate the transition from gasoline to electric vehicles.‚Äô [111] It is certainly notable that Elon Musk has investments in both electric cars and solar energy. The entrepreneur obviously sees synergies in respect of his ventures. 108 Ibid., 9. 109 Ibid. 9. 110 Ibid., 8. 111 Ibid., 8. 30 ----- ## Silicon Valley entrepreneur Aaron Levie, the CEO of Box Inc observed: ‚ÄòBy opening its patents, Tesla rightly realises it‚Äôs better to be the best product in a large industry than the only product in a niche one.‚Äô [112] Tesla Motors has been in discussions with BMW about standardizing electric cars. A BMW spokesman said: ‚ÄòBoth companies are strongly committed to the success of electro-mobility and discussed how to further strengthen the development of electro-mobility on an international level.‚Äô [113] There has been speculation about the development of a long-term deal between the two companies. [114] Writing in Slate, Will Oremus considered the announcement of Tesla Motors from a business perspective. He recognised: ‚ÄòThis might seem like a rash move for a company that still faces big hurdles on its path to long-term, mainstream success.‚Äô [115] Oremus anticipated a polarised 112 Associated Press, ‚ÄòTesla Hands Over the Keys to its Electric Car Technology‚Äô, *The Guardian*, 14 June 2014, http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/13/tesla - elon - musk - electric - cars - patent technology?CMP = twt _ gu 113 Edward Taylor, ‚ÄòBMW and Tesla Executives Meet to Discuss Electric Cars‚Äô, *Business Insider*, Reuters, 13 June 2014, http://www.businessinsider.com/r - bmw - and - tesla - executives - meet - to - discuss - electric - cars - 2014 13?IR = T 114 Neil Winton, ‚ÄòTesla Giveaway Spurs Speculation of Possible Deal with BMW‚Äô, *Forbes*, 13 June 2014, http://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2014/06/13/tesla - patent - giveaway - spurs - speculation - of - possible - deal with - bmw/ 115 Will Oremus, ‚ÄòTesla is Opening Its Patents to All.

Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country\'s currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country\'s ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4]\\n\\nComparisons of national wealth are also frequently made based on purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.[5]\\n\\nThe rankings of national economies over time have changed considerably; the economy of the United States surpassed the British Empire\'s output around 1916,[6] which in turn had surpassed the economy of the Qing dynasty in aggregate output decades earlier.[7][8] Since China\'s transition to a socialist market economy through controlled privatisation and deregulation,[9][10] the country has seen its ranking increase from ninth in 1978, to second in 2010; China\'s economic growth accelerated during this period and its share of global nominal GDP surged from 2% in 1980 to 18% in 2021.[8][1][11]\\n\\nThe first list includes estimates compiled by the International Monetary Fund\'s World Economic Outlook, the second list shows the World Bank\'s data, and the third list includes data compiled by the United Nations Statistics Division. The IMF\'s definitive data for the past year and estimates for the current year are published twice a year in April and October. Non-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition (such as Kosovo and Taiwan) are included in the list where they appear in the sources.\\n\\n## Table\\n\\n*The table initially ranks each IMF member including sovereign states not part of the IMF, non-sovereign nations and territories, and countries with limited

Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country\'s currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country\'s ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4]\\n\\nComparisons of national wealth are also frequently made based on purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.[5]\\n\\nThe rankings of national economies over time have changed considerably; the economy of the United States surpassed the British Empire\'s output around 1916,[6] which in turn had surpassed the economy of the Qing dynasty in aggregate output decades earlier.[7][8] Since China\'s transition to a socialist market economy through controlled privatisation and deregulation,[9][10] the country has seen its ranking increase from ninth in 1978, to second in 2010; China\'s economic growth accelerated during this period and its share of global nominal GDP surged from 2% in 1980 to 18% in 2021.[8][1][11]\\n\\nThe first list includes estimates compiled by the International Monetary Fund\'s World Economic Outlook, the second list shows the World Bank\'s data, and the third list includes data compiled by the United Nations Statistics Division. The IMF\'s definitive data for the past year and estimates for the current year are published twice a year in April and October. Non-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition (such as Kosovo and Taiwan) are included in the list where they appear in the sources.\\n\\n## Table\\n\\n*The table initially ranks each IMF member including sovereign states not part of the IMF, non-sovereign nations and territories, and countries with limited

Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country\'s currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country\'s ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4]\\n\\nComparisons of national wealth are also frequently made based on purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.[5]\\n\\nThe rankings of national economies over time have changed considerably; the economy of the United States surpassed the British Empire\'s output around 1916,[6] which in turn had surpassed the economy of the Qing dynasty in aggregate output decades earlier.[7][8] Since China\'s transition to a socialist market economy through controlled privatisation and deregulation,[9][10] the country has seen its ranking increase from ninth in 1978, to second in 2010; China\'s economic growth accelerated during this period and its share of global nominal GDP surged from 2% in 1980 to 18% in 2021.[8][1][11]\\n\\nThe first list includes estimates compiled by the International Monetary Fund\'s World Economic Outlook, the second list shows the World Bank\'s data, and the third list includes data compiled by the United Nations Statistics Division. The IMF\'s definitive data for the past year and estimates for the current year are published twice a year in April and October. Non-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition (such as Kosovo and Taiwan) are included in the list where they appear in the sources.\\n\\n## Table\\n\\n*The table initially ranks each IMF member including sovereign states not part of the IMF, non-sovereign nations and territories, and countries with limited

Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country\'s currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country\'s ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4]\\n\\nComparisons of national wealth are also frequently made based on purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.[5]\\n\\nThe rankings of national economies over time have changed considerably; the economy of the United States surpassed the British Empire\'s output around 1916,[6] which in turn had surpassed the economy of the Qing dynasty in aggregate output decades earlier.[7][8] Since China\'s transition to a socialist market economy through controlled privatisation and deregulation,[9][10] the country has seen its ranking increase from ninth in 1978, to second in 2010; China\'s economic growth accelerated during this period and its share of global nominal GDP surged from 2% in 1980 to 18% in 2021.[8][1][11]\\n\\nThe first list includes estimates compiled by the International Monetary Fund\'s World Economic Outlook, the second list shows the World Bank\'s data, and the third list includes data compiled by the United Nations Statistics Division. The IMF\'s definitive data for the past year and estimates for the current year are published twice a year in April and October. Non-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition (such as Kosovo and Taiwan) are included in the list where they appear in the sources.\\n\\n## Table\\n\\n*The table initially ranks each IMF member including sovereign states not part of the IMF, non-sovereign nations and territories, and countries with limited

Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country\'s currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country\'s ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4]\\n\\nComparisons of national wealth are also frequently made based on purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.[5]\\n\\nThe rankings of national economies over time have changed considerably; the economy of the United States surpassed the British Empire\'s output around 1916,[6] which in turn had surpassed the economy of the Qing dynasty in aggregate output decades earlier.[7][8] Since China\'s transition to a socialist market economy through controlled privatisation and deregulation,[9][10] the country has seen its ranking increase from ninth in 1978, to second in 2010; China\'s economic growth accelerated during this period and its share of global nominal GDP surged from 2% in 1980 to 18% in 2021.[8][1][11]\\n\\nThe first list includes estimates compiled by the International Monetary Fund\'s World Economic Outlook, the second list shows the World Bank\'s data, and the third list includes data compiled by the United Nations Statistics Division. The IMF\'s definitive data for the past year and estimates for the current year are published twice a year in April and October. Non-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition (such as Kosovo and Taiwan) are included in the list where they appear in the sources.\\n\\n## Table\\n\\n*The table initially ranks each IMF member including sovereign states not part of the IMF, non-sovereign nations and territories, and countries with limited

Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country\\\'s currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country\\\'s ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4]\\\\n\\\\nComparisons of national wealth are also frequently made based on purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.[5]\\\\n\\\\nThe rankings of national economies over time have changed considerably; the economy of the United States surpassed the British Empire\\\'s output around 1916,[6] which in turn had surpassed the economy of the Qing dynasty in aggregate output decades earlier.[7][8] Since China\\\'s transition to a socialist market economy through controlled privatisation and deregulation,[9][10] the country has seen its ranking increase from ninth in 1978, to second in 2010; China\\\'s economic growth accelerated during this period and its share of global nominal GDP surged from 2% in 1980 to 18% in 2021.[8][1][11]\\\\n\\\\nThe first list includes estimates compiled by the International Monetary Fund\\\'s World Economic Outlook, the second list shows the World Bank\\\'s data, and the third list includes data compiled by the United Nations Statistics Division. The IMF\\\'s definitive data for the past year and estimates for the current year are published twice a year in April and October. Non-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition (such as Kosovo and Taiwan) are included in the list where they appear
