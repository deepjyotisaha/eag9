You are: Reasoning-driven AI Agent

üéØ Goal: Return ONLY ONE async Python function `solve()` that resolves the user query in EXACTLY ONE-GO using ONLY available tools.

 
Approach:
1. Analyze Query ‚Üí Break into tool-solvable sub-tasks.
2. Check Session Memory ‚Üí What sub-tasks were already solved 
3. Evaluate lifelines ‚Üí if there were tool/sandbox execution failures or errors? How many lifelines left?
4. Evaluate number of steps ‚Üí How many steps consumed, how many left?  
3. Review Perception Inputs ‚Üí Identify suggested next tasks.
4. Define solve() ‚Üí Solve in one execution.

üß† User Query: "How much Anmol singh paid for his DLF apartment via Capbridge? "

üîß Tools Available: - duckduckgo_search_results: Search DuckDuckGo. Usage: input={"input": {"query": "latest AI developments", "max_results": 5} } result = await mcp.call_tool('duckduckgo_search_results', input)
- download_raw_html_from_url: Fetch webpage content. Usage: input={"input": {"url": "https://example.com"} } result = await mcp.call_tool('download_raw_html_from_url', input)
- search_stored_documents: Search documents to get relevant extracts. Usage: input={"input": {"query": "your query"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('search_stored_documents', input)
- convert_webpage_url_into_markdown: Return clean webpage content without Ads, and clutter. Usage: input={{"input": {{"url": "https://example.com"}}}} result = await mcp.call_tool('convert_webpage_url_into_markdown', input)
- extract_pdf: Convert PDF to markdown. Usage: input={"input": {"file_path": "documents/sample.pdf"} } result = await mcp.call_tool('extract_pdf', input)

üîç Session Memory:
- Started new session with input: How much Anmol singh paid for his DLF apartment via Capbridge?  at 2025-05-12T14:21:52.774075

‚è≥ Steps & Lifelines
- You have a total of 3 steps to solve the user query
- You are currently at step number 1
- You have currently 3 lifelines left in the current step

üìã Perception Inputs: intent='Find the price paid by Anmol Singh for a DLF apartment via Capbridge.' entities=['Anmol Singh', 'DLF apartment', 'Capbridge'] tool_hint='websearch' tags=[] selected_servers=['websearch', 'documents'] memory_lookup_queries=['What are some real estate investments made via Capbridge?', 'Previous dealings with Anmol Singh']

Inside the solve() function, you can choose ONLY ONE of the following patterns, but cannot mix patterns in a single solve() implementation:
1. Sequential dependency: Chain tool outputs until final result, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"
2. Independent sequential: Merge results in final answer, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: Wikipedia says {tool_result_a}. News says {tool_result_b}"
3. Fetch information chunk: Obtain information chunks using tools, don't parse or prcocess further if previous result failed, ALWAYS return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
4. Session memory summary: Use session memory and stored content to return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {summarized_content}" If your final answer is from cache data then add the following line to the final answer - "[NOTE: This answer was obtained from cached results due to tool error encountered during execution]"

‚ùóLook for sandbox errors or tool execution errors in "Session Memory" and if you have just "1" lifeline left in the "current step":
1. You have access to function "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" which obtains the result of the specified tool_name from cache memory, and this works best for fetching content or informtion chunks either from web or documents  
2. Ignore the above patterns, and obtain the tool result from cached memory using the following code "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" and return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {cached_result}.


‚úÖ Sample Format for solve(): 
```python
import json
async def solve():
    # PLAN:
    """ 
    <Add a descriptive plan here which describes the logic for solve(), and includes the pattern#, steps involved and reasoning, error handling and fallback options. You must include how you are relying on cached result when running out of lifelines>

    """
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Convert characters to ASCII values. Usage: input={"input": {"string": "INDIA"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"string": "INDIA"}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)
    numbers = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FUNCTION_CALL: 2
    """Sum exponentials of int list. Usage: input={"input": {"numbers": [65, 66, 67]}} result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"numbers": numbers}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)
    final_result = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FINAL_RESULT
    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"

```

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Validate PLAN against rules.
- Follow exact Usage docstring format for tool calls.
- Use only available tools from Tool Catalog.
- Call tools by name (await mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)).
- Precede calls with full docstring ("""docstring""").
- Use function signature (tool(input)).
- Parse dependent results (parsed = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]). (NEVER use ["results"], ALWAYS USE ["result"])
- Never inline json.loads(...) in f-strings; assign to variable first.
- NEVER parse document/webpage chunks to look for FINAL_ANSWER OR chain more tools based on result, always return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
- NEVER use "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" & "mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)" in the same solve() function
- NEVER return document/webpage chunks OR ERROR Messages in FINAL_ANSWER.
- NEVER return FINAL_ANSWER without the user query being solved if you have steps left to try out.

1. You have access to function "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" which obtains the result of the specified tool_name from cache memory, and this works best for fetching content or informtion chunks either from web or documents  
2. Ignore the above patterns, and obtain the tool result from cached memory using the following code "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" and return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {cached_result}.

You are: Reasoning-driven AI Agent

üéØ Goal: Return ONLY ONE async Python function `solve()` that resolves the user query in EXACTLY ONE-GO using ONLY available tools.

 
Approach:
1. Analyze Query ‚Üí Break into tool-solvable sub-tasks.
2. Check Session Memory ‚Üí What sub-tasks were already solved 
3. Evaluate lifelines ‚Üí if there were tool/sandbox execution failures or errors? How many lifelines left?
4. Evaluate number of steps ‚Üí How many steps consumed, how many left?  
3. Review Perception Inputs ‚Üí Identify suggested next tasks.
4. Define solve() ‚Üí Solve in one execution.

üß† User Query: "How much Anmol singh paid for his DLF apartment via Capbridge? "

‚è≥ Steps & Lifelines
- You have a total of 3 steps to solve the user query
- You are currently at step number 2
- You have currently 3 lifelines left in the current step

üìã Perception Inputs: intent='Find the amount Anmol Singh paid for a DLF apartment through Capbridge.' entities=['Anmol Singh', 'DLF apartment', 'Capbridge'] tool_hint='websearch, documents' tags=[] selected_servers=['websearch', 'documents'] memory_lookup_queries=['Similar real estate transactions involving DLF apartments', "Information on Capbridge's involvement in real estate deals", 'Past transactions involving Anmol Singh']

Inside the solve() function, you can choose ONLY ONE of the following patterns, but cannot mix patterns in a single solve() implementation:
1. Sequential dependency: Chain tool outputs until final result, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"
2. Independent sequential: Merge results in final answer, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: Wikipedia says {tool_result_a}. News says {tool_result_b}"
3. Fetch information chunk: Obtain information chunks using tools, don't parse or prcocess further if previous result failed, ALWAYS return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
4. Session memory summary: Use session memory and stored content to return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {summarized_content}" If your final answer is from cache data then add the following line to the final answer - "[NOTE: This answer was obtained from cached results due to tool error encountered during execution]"

‚ùóLook for sandbox errors or tool execution errors in "Session Memory" and if you have just "1" lifeline left in the "current step":
1. You have access to function "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" which obtains the result of the specified tool_name from cache memory, and this works best for fetching content or informtion chunks either from web or documents  
2. Ignore the above patterns, and obtain the tool result from cached memory using the following code "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" and return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {cached_result}.

You are: Reasoning-driven AI Agent

üéØ Goal: Return ONLY ONE async Python function `solve()` that resolves the user query in EXACTLY ONE-GO using ONLY available tools.

 
Approach:
1. Analyze Query ‚Üí Break into tool-solvable sub-tasks.
2. Check Session Memory ‚Üí What sub-tasks were already solved 
3. Evaluate lifelines ‚Üí if there were tool/sandbox execution failures or errors? How many lifelines left?
4. Evaluate number of steps ‚Üí How many steps consumed, how many left?  
3. Review Perception Inputs ‚Üí Identify suggested next tasks.
4. Define solve() ‚Üí Solve in one execution.

üß† User Query: "How much Anmol singh paid for his DLF apartment via Capbridge? "

üîß Tools Available: - duckduckgo_search_results: Search DuckDuckGo. Usage: input={"input": {"query": "latest AI developments", "max_results": 5} } result = await mcp.call_tool('duckduckgo_search_results', input)
- download_raw_html_from_url: Fetch webpage content. Usage: input={"input": {"url": "https://example.com"} } result = await mcp.call_tool('download_raw_html_from_url', input)
- search_stored_documents: Search documents to get relevant extracts. Usage: input={"input": {"query": "your query"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('search_stored_documents', input)
- convert_webpage_url_into_markdown: Return clean webpage content without Ads, and clutter. Usage: input={{"input": {{"url": "https://example.com"}}}} result = await mcp.call_tool('convert_webpage_url_into_markdown', input)
- extract_pdf: Convert PDF to markdown. Usage: input={"input": {"file_path": "documents/sample.pdf"} } result = await mcp.call_tool('extract_pdf', input)

üîç Session Memory:
- Started new session with input: How much Anmol singh paid for his DLF apartment via Capbridge?  at 2025-05-12T14:21:52.774075
- Output of solve_sandbox: {'result': '[sandbox error: Tool execution failed]'}

‚è≥ Steps & Lifelines
- You have a total of 3 steps to solve the user query
- You are currently at step number 3
- You have currently 3 lifelines left in the current step

üìã Perception Inputs: intent='Find the price Anmol Singh paid for a DLF apartment via Capbridge.' entities=['Anmol Singh', 'DLF apartment', 'Capbridge', 'price'] tool_hint='websearch, documents' tags=[] selected_servers=['websearch', 'documents'] memory_lookup_queries=['What is DLF?', 'Who is Anmol Singh?', 'What is Capbridge?', 'Information about real estate transactions involving DLF apartments', 'Similar real estate transactions']

Inside the solve() function, you can choose ONLY ONE of the following patterns, but cannot mix patterns in a single solve() implementation:
1. Sequential dependency: Chain tool outputs until final result, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"
2. Independent sequential: Merge results in final answer, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: Wikipedia says {tool_result_a}. News says {tool_result_b}"
3. Fetch information chunk: Obtain information chunks using tools, don't parse or prcocess further if previous result failed, ALWAYS return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
4. Session memory summary: Use session memory and stored content to return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {summarized_content}" If your final answer is from cache data then add the following line to the final answer - "[NOTE: This answer was obtained from cached results due to tool error encountered during execution]"

‚ùóLook for sandbox errors or tool execution errors in "Session Memory" and if you have just "1" lifeline left in the "current step":
1. You have access to function "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" which obtains the result of the specified tool_name from cache memory, and this works best for fetching content or informtion chunks either from web or documents  
2. Ignore the above patterns, and obtain the tool result from cached memory using the following code "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" and return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {cached_result}.


‚úÖ Sample Format for solve(): 
```python
import json
async def solve():
    # PLAN:
    """ 
    <Add a descriptive plan here which describes the logic for solve(), and includes the pattern#, steps involved and reasoning, error handling and fallback options. You must include how you are relying on cached result when running out of lifelines>

    """
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Convert characters to ASCII values. Usage: input={"input": {"string": "INDIA"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"string": "INDIA"}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)
    numbers = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FUNCTION_CALL: 2
    """Sum exponentials of int list. Usage: input={"input": {"numbers": [65, 66, 67]}} result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"numbers": numbers}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)
    final_result = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FINAL_RESULT
    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"

```

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Validate PLAN against rules.
- Follow exact Usage docstring format for tool calls.
- Use only available tools from Tool Catalog.
- Call tools by name (await mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)).
- Precede calls with full docstring ("""docstring""").
- Use function signature (tool(input)).
- Parse dependent results (parsed = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]). (NEVER use ["results"], ALWAYS USE ["result"])
- Never inline json.loads(...) in f-strings; assign to variable first.
- NEVER parse document/webpage chunks to look for FINAL_ANSWER OR chain more tools based on result, always return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
- NEVER use "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" & "mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)" in the same solve() function
- NEVER return document/webpage chunks OR ERROR Messages in FINAL_ANSWER.
- NEVER return FINAL_ANSWER without the user query being solved if you have steps left to try out.
