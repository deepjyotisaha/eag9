üß† User Query:

Here are some more inputs on the user input and required next steps:
intent='Find the amount Anmol Singh paid for a DLF apartment through Capbridge.' entities=['Anmol Singh', 'DLF apartment', 'Capbridge'] tool_hint='websearch: to find news articles or real estate records related to the transaction.' tags=[] selected_servers=['websearch', 'documents']0

Here are the details of the progress so far:
- Started new session with input: How much Anmol singh paid for his DLF apartment via Capbridge? at 2025-05-06T13:17:42.452550

üéØ Goal:
Write a valid async Python function named `solve()` that solves the user query using exactly ONE FUNCTION_CALL.

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Plan exactly ONE FUNCTION_CALL only.
- You must always define a function `async def solve():`
- Each tool call must follow the Usage docstring format exactly.
- You MUST call only those tools that are available in Tool Catalog.
- Call a tool using its tool name string, not function variable.
  E.g., await mcp.call_tool('add', input)
  (NOT await mcp.call_tool(add, input))
- Before each tool call, paste the full tool docstring enclosed in triple quotes (""").
- Call the tool exactly as per its function signature: tool(input)
- If one FUNCTION_CALL depends on another, parse the previous result using json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"] to extract the value from the tool's JSON output.
-‚ùóImportant: Never inline json.loads(...) inside f"" strings. Always assign it to a variable first (e.g., parsed = json.loads(...)["result"]) and use that in return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {parsed}".
- End your function by returning a string that starts with 'FINAL_ANSWER: ' or 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: '
- If the tool result is a document, webpage, or unstructured chunk, DO NOT return it as the FINAL_ANSWER.
- Instead, return it with 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED:' so the agent can interpret and summarize it next.
- If in one of the previous results there is a document, webpage, or unstructured chunk, first analyze and determine if you have the information to give the FINAL_ANSWER, if yes then return FINAL_ANSWER

- No fallback, no multiple options.
- No explanation, no narration ‚Äî only valid Python code.
- If the user input already includes clean extracted webpage/document content, do NOT call the tool again. Summarize or generate the final answer from it.


‚úÖ Example 1: Output of last function parsed for next function
```python
import json
async def solve():
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Convert characters to ASCII values. Usage: input={"input": {"string": "INDIA"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"string": "INDIA"}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)
    numbers = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FUNCTION_CALL: 2
    """Sum exponentials of int list. Usage: input={"input": {"numbers": [65, 66, 67]}} result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"numbers": numbers}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)
    final_result = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FINAL_RESULT
    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"

```

---

‚úÖ Example 2: Independent but sequential tool use
```python
import json
async def solve():
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Search Wikipedia. Usage: input={"input": {"query": "Artificial Intelligence"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('search', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"query": "Artificial Intelligence"}}
    result1 = await mcp.call_tool('search', input)
    wiki_text = json.loads(result1.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FUNCTION_CALL: 2
    """Fetch News Articles. Usage: input={"input": {"query": "Artificial Intelligence latest news"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('fetch_news', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"query": "Artificial Intelligence latest news"}}
    result2 = await mcp.call_tool('fetch_news', input)
    news_text = json.loads(result2.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FINAL_RESULT
    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: Wikipedia says {wiki_text}. News says {news_text}."


```

---

‚úÖ Example 3: Fallback logic, parsing not required
```python
import json
async def solve():
    try:
        # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
        """Fetch Company Overview. Usage: input={"company_name": "Tesla"} result = await mcp.call_tool('company_overview', input)"""
        input = {"input": {"company_name": "Tesla"}}
        result = await mcp.call_tool('company_overview', input)

    except Exception:
        try:
            # FUNCTION_CALL: 2
            """Fetch Company Backup Profile. Usage: input={"company_name": "Tesla"} result = await mcp.call_tool('backup_company_profile', input)"""
            input = {"input": {"company_name": "Tesla"}}
            result = await mcp.call_tool('backup_company_profile', input)

        except Exception:
            result = {"content": [{"text": "{\\"result\\": \\"Information not available.\\"}"}], "meta": None}

    # FINAL_RESULT
    if isinstance(result, CallToolResult):
        final_result = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]
    else:
        final_result = json.loads(result["content"][0]["text"])["result"]

    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"


```

---

‚úÖ Example 4: FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: Summarize a document or webpage or similar example where you need information to take next action:
```python
async def solve():
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Return clean webpage content. Usage: input={"input": {"url": "https://example.com"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('extract_webpage', input)"""
    input = {"url": "https://www.f1.com"}
    result = await mcp.call_tool(extract_webpage, input)  # from mcp_server_2

    # FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED
    return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {result}"

```

‚úÖ Example 5: Summarize content you have already fetched in previous steps
```python
async def solve():

    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {summarized_content}"

```

üí° Tips:

If the task can be solved by one tool, stop after that.

You must return the result immediately using 'FINAL_ANSWER:' if you got the result for the user's task, or 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED:'. 

Some times you WILL need to further process the results, like after looking at document, search or webpage parsed, summarizing it. Use 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED:' ONLY in cases you dont have the final answer; If you have the final answer, use 'FINAL_ANSWER:'.
Use chaining only if necessary, but never plan more than 1 tool call.

üéØ Goal:
Write a valid async Python function named `solve()` that solves the user query using exactly ONE FUNCTION_CALL.

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Plan exactly ONE FUNCTION_CALL only.
- You must always define a function `async def solve():`
- Each tool call must follow the Usage docstring format exactly.
- You MUST call only those tools that are available in Tool Catalog.
- Call a tool using its tool name string, not function variable.
  E.g., await mcp.call_tool('add', input)
  (NOT await mcp.call_tool(add, input))
- Before each tool call, paste the full tool docstring enclosed in triple quotes (""").
- Call the tool exactly as per its function signature: tool(input)
- If one FUNCTION_CALL depends on another, parse the previous result using json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"] to extract the value from the tool's JSON output.
-‚ùóImportant: Never inline json.loads(...) inside f"" strings. Always assign it to a variable first (e.g., parsed = json.loads(...)["result"]) and use that in return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {parsed}".
- End your function by returning a string that starts with 'FINAL_ANSWER: ' or 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: '
- If the tool result is a document, webpage, or unstructured chunk, DO NOT return it as the FINAL_ANSWER.
- Instead, return it with 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED:' so the agent can interpret and summarize it next.
- If in one of the previous results there is a document, webpage, or unstructured chunk, first analyze and determine if you have the information to give the FINAL_ANSWER, if yes then return FINAL_ANSWER

- No fallback, no multiple options.
- No explanation, no narration ‚Äî only valid Python code.
- If the user input already includes clean extracted webpage/document content, do NOT call the tool again. Summarize or generate the final answer from it.


‚úÖ Example 1: Output of last function parsed for next function
```python
import json
async def solve():
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Convert characters to ASCII values. Usage: input={"input": {"string": "INDIA"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"string": "INDIA"}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)
    numbers = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FUNCTION_CALL: 2
    """Sum exponentials of int list. Usage: input={"input": {"numbers": [65, 66, 67]}} result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"numbers": numbers}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)
    final_result = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FINAL_RESULT
    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"

```

---

‚úÖ Example 2: Independent but sequential tool use
```python
import json
async def solve():
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Search Wikipedia. Usage: input={"input": {"query": "Artificial Intelligence"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('search', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"query": "Artificial Intelligence"}}
    result1 = await mcp.call_tool('search', input)
    wiki_text = json.loads(result1.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FUNCTION_CALL: 2
    """Fetch News Articles. Usage: input={"input": {"query": "Artificial Intelligence latest news"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('fetch_news', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"query": "Artificial Intelligence latest news"}}
    result2 = await mcp.call_tool('fetch_news', input)
    news_text = json.loads(result2.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FINAL_RESULT
    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: Wikipedia says {wiki_text}. News says {news_text}."


```

---

‚úÖ Example 3: Fallback logic, parsing not required
```python
import json
async def solve():
    try:
        # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
        """Fetch Company Overview. Usage: input={"company_name": "Tesla"} result = await mcp.call_tool('company_overview', input)"""
        input = {"input": {"company_name": "Tesla"}}
        result = await mcp.call_tool('company_overview', input)

    except Exception:
        try:
            # FUNCTION_CALL: 2
            """Fetch Company Backup Profile. Usage: input={"company_name": "Tesla"} result = await mcp.call_tool('backup_company_profile', input)"""
            input = {"input": {"company_name": "Tesla"}}
            result = await mcp.call_tool('backup_company_profile', input)

        except Exception:
            result = {"content": [{"text": "{\\"result\\": \\"Information not available.\\"}"}], "meta": None}

    # FINAL_RESULT
    if isinstance(result, CallToolResult):
        final_result = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]
    else:
        final_result = json.loads(result["content"][0]["text"])["result"]

    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"


```

---

‚úÖ Example 4: FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: Summarize a document or webpage or similar example where you need information to take next action:
```python
async def solve():
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Return clean webpage content. Usage: input={"input": {"url": "https://example.com"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('extract_webpage', input)"""
    input = {"url": "https://www.f1.com"}
    result = await mcp.call_tool(extract_webpage, input)  # from mcp_server_2

    # FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED
    return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {result}"

```

‚úÖ Example 5: Summarize content you have already fetched in previous steps
```python
async def solve():

    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {summarized_content}"

```

üí° Tips:

If the task can be solved by one tool, stop after that.

You must return the result immediately using 'FINAL_ANSWER:' if you got the result for the user's task, or 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED:'. 

Some times you WILL need to further process the results, like after looking at document, search or webpage parsed, summarizing it. Use 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED:' ONLY in cases you dont have the final answer; If you have the final answer, use 'FINAL_ANSWER:'.
Use chaining only if necessary, but never plan more than 1 tool call.

DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company's $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India's biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of ‚Çπ31.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of ‚Çπ15.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF's first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company's growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A ‚Çπ58 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to ‚Çπ2 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi.

It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company's $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India's biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of ‚Çπ31.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of ‚Çπ15.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF's first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company's growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A ‚Çπ58 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to ‚Çπ2 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon.

It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company\'s $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India\'s biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of ‚Çπ31.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of ‚Çπ15.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF\'s first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A ‚Çπ58 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to ‚Çπ2 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon.

üéØ Goal:
Write a valid async Python function named `solve()` that solves the user query using exactly ONE FUNCTION_CALL.

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Plan exactly ONE FUNCTION_CALL only.
- You must always define a function `async def solve():`
- Each tool call must follow the Usage docstring format exactly.
- You MUST call only those tools that are available in Tool Catalog.
- Call a tool using its tool name string, not function variable.
  E.g., await mcp.call_tool('add', input)
  (NOT await mcp.call_tool(add, input))
- Before each tool call, paste the full tool docstring enclosed in triple quotes (""").
- Call the tool exactly as per its function signature: tool(input)
- If one FUNCTION_CALL depends on another, parse the previous result using json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"] to extract the value from the tool's JSON output.
-‚ùóImportant: Never inline json.loads(...) inside f"" strings. Always assign it to a variable first (e.g., parsed = json.loads(...)["result"]) and use that in return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {parsed}".
- End your function by returning a string that starts with 'FINAL_ANSWER: ' or 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: '
- If the tool result is a document, webpage, or unstructured chunk, DO NOT return it as the FINAL_ANSWER.
- Instead, return it with 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED:' so the agent can interpret and summarize it next.
- If in one of the previous results there is a document, webpage, or unstructured chunk, first analyze and determine if you have the information to give the FINAL_ANSWER, if yes then return FINAL_ANSWER

- No fallback, no multiple options.
- No explanation, no narration ‚Äî only valid Python code.
- If the user input already includes clean extracted webpage/document content, do NOT call the tool again. Summarize or generate the final answer from it.


‚úÖ Example 1: Output of last function parsed for next function
```python
import json
async def solve():
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Convert characters to ASCII values. Usage: input={"input": {"string": "INDIA"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"string": "INDIA"}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)

‚úÖ Example 5: Summarize content you have already fetched in previous steps
```python
async def solve():

    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {summarized_content}"

```

üí° Tips:

If the task can be solved by one tool, stop after that.

You must return the result immediately using 'FINAL_ANSWER:' if you got the result for the user's task, or 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED:'. 

Some times you WILL need to further process the results, like after looking at document, search or webpage parsed, summarizing it. Use 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED:' ONLY in cases you dont have the final answer; If you have the final answer, use 'FINAL_ANSWER:'.
Use chaining only if necessary, but never plan more than 1 tool call.

It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company's $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India's biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of ‚Çπ31.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of ‚Çπ15.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF's first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company's growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P.

It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company's $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India's biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of ‚Çπ31.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of ‚Çπ15.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF's first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company's growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A ‚Çπ58 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to ‚Çπ2 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi.

It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company\'s $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India\'s biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of ‚Çπ31.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of ‚Çπ15.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF\'s first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A ‚Çπ58 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to ‚Çπ2 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi.

It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company\'s $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India\'s biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of ‚Çπ31.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of ‚Çπ15.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF\'s first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A ‚Çπ58 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league.

- Started new session with input:  at 2025-05-06T13:20:15.132211

üéØ Goal:
Write a valid async Python function named `solve()` that solves the user query using exactly ONE FUNCTION_CALL.

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Plan exactly ONE FUNCTION_CALL only.
- You must always define a function `async def solve():`
- Each tool call must follow the Usage docstring format exactly.
- You MUST call only those tools that are available in Tool Catalog.
- Call a tool using its tool name string, not function variable.
  E.g., await mcp.call_tool('add', input)
  (NOT await mcp.call_tool(add, input))
- Before each tool call, paste the full tool docstring enclosed in triple quotes (""").
- Call the tool exactly as per its function signature: tool(input)
- If one FUNCTION_CALL depends on another, parse the previous result using json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"] to extract the value from the tool's JSON output.
-‚ùóImportant: Never inline json.loads(...) inside f"" strings. Always assign it to a variable first (e.g., parsed = json.loads(...)["result"]) and use that in return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {parsed}".
- End your function by returning a string that starts with 'FINAL_ANSWER: ' or 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: '
- If the tool result is a document, webpage, or unstructured chunk, DO NOT return it as the FINAL_ANSWER.
- Instead, return it with 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED:' so the agent can interpret and summarize it next.
- If in one of the previous results there is a document, webpage, or unstructured chunk, first analyze and determine if you have the information to give the FINAL_ANSWER, if yes then return FINAL_ANSWER

- No fallback, no multiple options.
- No explanation, no narration ‚Äî only valid Python code.
- If the user input already includes clean extracted webpage/document content, do NOT call the tool again. Summarize or generate the final answer from it.


‚úÖ Example 1: Output of last function parsed for next function
```python
import json
async def solve():
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Convert characters to ASCII values. Usage: input={"input": {"string": "INDIA"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"string": "INDIA"}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)
    numbers = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FUNCTION_CALL: 2
    """Sum exponentials of int list. Usage: input={"input": {"numbers": [65, 66, 67]}} result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"numbers": numbers}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)
    final_result = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FINAL_RESULT
    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"

```

---

‚úÖ Example 2: Independent but sequential tool use
```python
import json
async def solve():
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Search Wikipedia. Usage: input={"input": {"query": "Artificial Intelligence"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('search', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"query": "Artificial Intelligence"}}
    result1 = await mcp.call_tool('search', input)
    wiki_text = json.loads(result1.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FUNCTION_CALL: 2
    """Fetch News Articles. Usage: input={"input": {"query": "Artificial Intelligence latest news"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('fetch_news', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"query": "Artificial Intelligence latest news"}}
    result2 = await mcp.call_tool('fetch_news', input)
    news_text = json.loads(result2.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FINAL_RESULT
    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: Wikipedia says {wiki_text}. News says {news_text}."


```

‚úÖ Example 3: Fallback logic, parsing not required
```python
import json
async def solve():
    try:
        # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
        """Fetch Company Overview. Usage: input={"company_name": "Tesla"} result = await mcp.call_tool('company_overview', input)"""
        input = {"input": {"company_name": "Tesla"}}
        result = await mcp.call_tool('company_overview', input)

    except Exception:
        try:
            # FUNCTION_CALL: 2
            """Fetch Company Backup Profile. Usage: input={"company_name": "Tesla"} result = await mcp.call_tool('backup_company_profile', input)"""
            input = {"input": {"company_name": "Tesla"}}
            result = await mcp.call_tool('backup_company_profile', input)

        except Exception:
            result = {"content": [{"text": "{\\"result\\": \\"Information not available.\\"}"}], "meta": None}

    # FINAL_RESULT
    if isinstance(result, CallToolResult):
        final_result = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]
    else:
        final_result = json.loads(result["content"][0]["text"])["result"]

    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"


```

‚úÖ Example 4: FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: Summarize a document or webpage or similar example where you need information to take next action:
```python
async def solve():
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Return clean webpage content. Usage: input={"input": {"url": "https://example.com"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('extract_webpage', input)"""
    input = {"url": "https://www.f1.com"}
    result = await mcp.call_tool(extract_webpage, input)  # from mcp_server_2

    # FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED
    return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {result}"

```

‚úÖ Example 5: Summarize content you have already fetched in previous steps
```python
async def solve():

    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {summarized_content}"

```

üí° Tips:

If the task can be solved by one tool, stop after that.

You must return the result immediately using 'FINAL_ANSWER:' if you got the result for the user's task, or 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED:'. 

Some times you WILL need to further process the results, like after looking at document, search or webpage parsed, summarizing it. Use 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED:' ONLY in cases you dont have the final answer; If you have the final answer, use 'FINAL_ANSWER:'.
Use chaining only if necessary, but never plan more than 1 tool call.
