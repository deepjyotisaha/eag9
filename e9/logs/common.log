You are: Reasoning-driven AI Agent

üéØ Goal: Return ONLY ONE async Python function `solve()` that resolves the user query in EXACTLY ONE-GO using ONLY available tools.

 
Approach:
1. Analyze Query ‚Üí Break into tool-solvable sub-tasks.
2. Check Session Memory ‚Üí What sub-tasks were already solved 
3. Evaluate lifelines ‚Üí if there were tool/sandbox execution failures or errors? How many lifelines left?
4. Evaluate number of steps ‚Üí How many steps consumed, how many left?  
3. Review Perception Inputs ‚Üí Identify suggested next tasks.
4. Define solve() ‚Üí Solve in one execution.

üß† User Query: "How much Anmol singh paid for his DLF apartment via Capbridge? "

üîß Tools Available: - duckduckgo_search_results: Search DuckDuckGo. Usage: input={"input": {"query": "latest AI developments", "max_results": 5} } result = await mcp.call_tool('duckduckgo_search_results', input)
- download_raw_html_from_url: Fetch webpage content. Usage: input={"input": {"url": "https://example.com"} } result = await mcp.call_tool('download_raw_html_from_url', input)
- search_stored_documents: Search documents to get relevant extracts. Usage: input={"input": {"query": "your query"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('search_stored_documents', input)
- convert_webpage_url_into_markdown: Return clean webpage content without Ads, and clutter. Usage: input={{"input": {{"url": "https://example.com"}}}} result = await mcp.call_tool('convert_webpage_url_into_markdown', input)
- extract_pdf: Convert PDF to markdown. Usage: input={"input": {"file_path": "documents/sample.pdf"} } result = await mcp.call_tool('extract_pdf', input)

üîç Session Memory:
- Started new session with input: How much Anmol singh paid for his DLF apartment via Capbridge?  at 2025-05-11T19:41:34.077289

‚è≥ Steps & Lifelines
- You have a total of 3 steps to solve the user query
- You are currently at step number 1
- You have currently 3 lifelines left for the current step

üìã Perception Inputs: intent='Find the price Anmol Singh paid for a DLF apartment via Capbridge.' entities=['Anmol Singh', 'DLF apartment', 'Capbridge'] tool_hint='Potentially a web search to find news articles or real estate records.' tags=[] selected_servers=['websearch', 'documents'] memory_lookup_queries=['What is Capbridge?', 'What are recent real estate transactions involving DLF apartments?']

You can choose ONE of the following patterns inside the solve() function based on what is needed to answer the user query:
1. Sequential dependency: Chain tool outputs until final result, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"
2. Independent sequential: Merge results in final answer, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: Wikipedia says {tool_result_a}. News says {tool_result_b}"
3. Fetch information chunk: Obtain information chunks using tools, don't parse or prcocess further if previous result failed, ALWAYS return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
4. Session memory summary: Use session memory and stored content to return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {summarized_content}" If your final answer is from cache data then add the following line to the final answer - "[NOTE: This answer was obtained from cached results due to tool error encountered during execution]"

‚ùó Sandbox Error or Tool Execution Error Handling:
1. If sandbox encounters error during execution OR if the tool execition fails - then you cannot obtain an answer via "mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)". 
2. If you have encountered sandbox error OR tool execution error AND have tried atleast twice, you might have just 1 lifeline left - In such cases ALWAYS directly substitute tool results using "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name). DONT call "mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)" again. 
3. get_tool_results_from_cache() works best for fetching content or informtion chunks either from web or documents 
4. Never parse the cached_result and ALWAYS DIRECTLY return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {cached_result}. 
5. You MUST first obtain the cached_result using "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" before returning it. 


‚úÖ Sample Format for solve(): 
```python
import json
async def solve():
    # PLAN:
    """ 
    <Add a descriptive plan here which describes the logic for solve(), and includes the pattern#, steps involved and reasoning, error handling and fallback options. You must include how you are relying on cached result when running out of lifelines>

    """
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Convert characters to ASCII values. Usage: input={"input": {"string": "INDIA"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"string": "INDIA"}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)
    numbers = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FUNCTION_CALL: 2
    """Sum exponentials of int list. Usage: input={"input": {"numbers": [65, 66, 67]}} result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"numbers": numbers}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)
    final_result = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FINAL_RESULT
    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"

```

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Validate PLAN against rules.
- Follow exact Usage docstring format for tool calls.
- Use only available tools from Tool Catalog.
- Call tools by name (await mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)).
- Precede calls with full docstring ("""docstring""").
- Use function signature (tool(input)).
- Parse dependent results (parsed = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]). (NEVER use ["results"], ALWAYS USE ["result"])
- Never inline json.loads(...) in f-strings; assign to variable first.
- NEVER parse document/webpage chunks to look for FINAL_ANSWER OR chain more tools based on result, always return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
- NEVER return document/webpage chunks OR ERROR in FINAL_ANSWER.
- NEVER return FINAL_ANSWER without the user query being solved if you have steps left to try out.

You are: Reasoning-driven AI Agent

üéØ Goal: Return ONLY ONE async Python function `solve()` that resolves the user query in EXACTLY ONE-GO using ONLY available tools.

 
Approach:
1. Analyze Query ‚Üí Break into tool-solvable sub-tasks.
2. Check Session Memory ‚Üí What sub-tasks were already solved 
3. Evaluate lifelines ‚Üí if there were tool/sandbox execution failures or errors? How many lifelines left?
4. Evaluate number of steps ‚Üí How many steps consumed, how many left?  
3. Review Perception Inputs ‚Üí Identify suggested next tasks.
4. Define solve() ‚Üí Solve in one execution.

üß† User Query: "How much Anmol singh paid for his DLF apartment via Capbridge? "

üîß Tools Available: - search_stored_documents: Search documents to get relevant extracts. Usage: input={"input": {"query": "your query"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('search_stored_documents', input)
- convert_webpage_url_into_markdown: Return clean webpage content without Ads, and clutter. Usage: input={{"input": {{"url": "https://example.com"}}}} result = await mcp.call_tool('convert_webpage_url_into_markdown', input)
- extract_pdf: Convert PDF to markdown. Usage: input={"input": {"file_path": "documents/sample.pdf"} } result = await mcp.call_tool('extract_pdf', input)
- duckduckgo_search_results: Search DuckDuckGo. Usage: input={"input": {"query": "latest AI developments", "max_results": 5} } result = await mcp.call_tool('duckduckgo_search_results', input)
- download_raw_html_from_url: Fetch webpage content. Usage: input={"input": {"url": "https://example.com"} } result = await mcp.call_tool('download_raw_html_from_url', input)

‚è≥ Steps & Lifelines
- You have a total of 3 steps to solve the user query
- You are currently at step number 1
- You have currently 2 lifelines left for the current step

üìã Perception Inputs: intent='Find the price Anmol Singh paid for a DLF apartment through Capbridge.' entities=['Anmol Singh', 'DLF apartment', 'Capbridge'] tool_hint='Use documents and websearch to find news articles or reports about the transaction.' tags=[] selected_servers=['documents', 'websearch'] memory_lookup_queries=['Previous real estate transactions involving Anmol Singh', 'Information on Capbridge deals']

You can choose ONE of the following patterns inside the solve() function based on what is needed to answer the user query:
1. Sequential dependency: Chain tool outputs until final result, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"
2. Independent sequential: Merge results in final answer, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: Wikipedia says {tool_result_a}. News says {tool_result_b}"
3. Fetch information chunk: Obtain information chunks using tools, don't parse or prcocess further if previous result failed, ALWAYS return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
4. Session memory summary: Use session memory and stored content to return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {summarized_content}" If your final answer is from cache data then add the following line to the final answer - "[NOTE: This answer was obtained from cached results due to tool error encountered during execution]"

‚ùó Sandbox Error or Tool Execution Error Handling:
1. If sandbox encounters error during execution OR if the tool execition fails - then you cannot obtain an answer via "mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)". 
2. If you have encountered sandbox error OR tool execution error AND have tried atleast twice, you might have just 1 lifeline left - In such cases ALWAYS directly substitute tool results using "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name). DONT call "mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)" again. 
3. get_tool_results_from_cache() works best for fetching content or informtion chunks either from web or documents 
4. Never parse the cached_result and ALWAYS DIRECTLY return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {cached_result}. 
5. You MUST first obtain the cached_result using "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" before returning it.

    # PLAN:
    """ 
    <Add a descriptive plan here which describes the logic for solve(), and includes the pattern#, steps involved and reasoning, error handling and fallback options. You must include how you are relying on cached result when running out of lifelines>

    """
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Convert characters to ASCII values. Usage: input={"input": {"string": "INDIA"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"string": "INDIA"}}

    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"

```

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Validate PLAN against rules.
- Follow exact Usage docstring format for tool calls.
- Use only available tools from Tool Catalog.
- Call tools by name (await mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)).
- Precede calls with full docstring ("""docstring""").
- Use function signature (tool(input)).
- Parse dependent results (parsed = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]). (NEVER use ["results"], ALWAYS USE ["result"])
- Never inline json.loads(...) in f-strings; assign to variable first.
- NEVER parse document/webpage chunks to look for FINAL_ANSWER OR chain more tools based on result, always return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
- NEVER return document/webpage chunks OR ERROR in FINAL_ANSWER.
- NEVER return FINAL_ANSWER without the user query being solved if you have steps left to try out.

The complaint was lodged against DLF by buyers in its residential projects Belaire & Park Place, located in Gurgaon.[19] In February 2015, the CCI ordered its investigative arm to probe two more projects of DLF in Gurgaon, namely, DLF Regal Gardens[20] and DLF Skycourt.[21][22] DLF land grab case pertains to the alleged illegal acquisition of 50 acres of land in Amipur village, Haryana, back in 2013, during Bhupinder Singh Hooda's tenure as Chief Minister under the Congress government. This matter has led to an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation involving Robert Vadra, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and the DLF, as of around December 2017.[23]\n[Source: dlf.md, ID: dlf_1]", annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text="DLF Limited (formerly Delhi Land & Finance) is an Indian commercial real estate development company. It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company's $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India's biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of ‚Çπ31.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of ‚Çπ15.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF's first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company's growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A ‚Çπ58 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to ‚Çπ2 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon.

The complaint was lodged against DLF by buyers in its residential projects Belaire & Park Place, located in Gurgaon.[19] In February 2015, the CCI ordered its investigative arm to probe two more projects of DLF in Gurgaon, namely, DLF Regal Gardens[20] and DLF Skycourt.[21][22] DLF land grab case pertains to the alleged illegal acquisition of 50 acres of land in Amipur village, Haryana, back in 2013, during Bhupinder Singh Hooda's tenure as Chief Minister under the Congress government. This matter has led to an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation involving Robert Vadra, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and the DLF, as of around December 2017.[23]\n[Source: dlf.md, ID: dlf_1]", annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text="DLF Limited (formerly Delhi Land & Finance) is an Indian commercial real estate development company. It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company's $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India's biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of ‚Çπ31.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of ‚Çπ15.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF's first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company's growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A ‚Çπ58 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to ‚Çπ2 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon.

‚è≥ Steps & Lifelines
- You have a total of 3 steps to solve the user query
- You are currently at step number 1
- You have currently 1 lifelines left for the current step

üìã Perception Inputs: intent='Find the price Anmol Singh paid for a DLF apartment via Capbridge.' entities=['Anmol Singh', 'DLF apartment', 'Capbridge'] tool_hint='Likely needs web search and document analysis to find the transaction details.' tags=[] selected_servers=['websearch', 'documents'] memory_lookup_queries=['What is Capbridge used for?', 'Previous real estate transactions involving Anmol Singh', 'Details on DLF apartment sales']

You can choose ONE of the following patterns inside the solve() function based on what is needed to answer the user query:
1. Sequential dependency: Chain tool outputs until final result, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"
2. Independent sequential: Merge results in final answer, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: Wikipedia says {tool_result_a}. News says {tool_result_b}"
3. Fetch information chunk: Obtain information chunks using tools, don't parse or prcocess further if previous result failed, ALWAYS return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
4. Session memory summary: Use session memory and stored content to return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {summarized_content}" If your final answer is from cache data then add the following line to the final answer - "[NOTE: This answer was obtained from cached results due to tool error encountered during execution]"

‚ùó Sandbox Error or Tool Execution Error Handling:
1. If sandbox encounters error during execution OR if the tool execition fails - then you cannot obtain an answer via "mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)". 
2. If you have encountered sandbox error OR tool execution error AND have tried atleast twice, you might have just 1 lifeline left - In such cases ALWAYS directly substitute tool results using "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name). DONT call "mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)" again. 
3. get_tool_results_from_cache() works best for fetching content or informtion chunks either from web or documents 
4. Never parse the cached_result and ALWAYS DIRECTLY return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {cached_result}. 
5. You MUST first obtain the cached_result using "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" before returning it. 


‚úÖ Sample Format for solve(): 
```python
import json

    # PLAN:
    """ 
    <Add a descriptive plan here which describes the logic for solve(), and includes the pattern#, steps involved and reasoning, error handling and fallback options. You must include how you are relying on cached result when running out of lifelines>

    """
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Convert characters to ASCII values. Usage: input={"input": {"string": "INDIA"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)"""

    # FINAL_RESULT
    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"

```

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Validate PLAN against rules.
- Follow exact Usage docstring format for tool calls.
- Use only available tools from Tool Catalog.
- Call tools by name (await mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)).
- Precede calls with full docstring ("""docstring""").
- Use function signature (tool(input)).
- Parse dependent results (parsed = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]). (NEVER use ["results"], ALWAYS USE ["result"])
- Never inline json.loads(...) in f-strings; assign to variable first.
- NEVER parse document/webpage chunks to look for FINAL_ANSWER OR chain more tools based on result, always return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
- NEVER return document/webpage chunks OR ERROR in FINAL_ANSWER.
- NEVER return FINAL_ANSWER without the user query being solved if you have steps left to try out.

It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company's $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India's biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of ‚Çπ31.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of ‚Çπ15.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF's first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company's growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A ‚Çπ58 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league.

4. Session memory summary: Use session memory and stored content to return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {summarized_content}" If your final answer is from cache data then add the following line to the final answer - "[NOTE: This answer was obtained from cached results due to tool error encountered during execution]"

‚ùó Sandbox Error or Tool Execution Error Handling:
1. If sandbox encounters error during execution OR if the tool execition fails - then you cannot obtain an answer via "mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)". 
2. If you have encountered sandbox error OR tool execution error AND have tried atleast twice, you might have just 1 lifeline left - In such cases ALWAYS directly substitute tool results using "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name). DONT call "mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)" again. 
3. get_tool_results_from_cache() works best for fetching content or informtion chunks either from web or documents 
4. Never parse the cached_result and ALWAYS DIRECTLY return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {cached_result}. 
5. You MUST first obtain the cached_result using "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" before returning it. 


‚úÖ Sample Format for solve(): 
```python
import json
async def solve():
    # PLAN:
    """ 
    <Add a descriptive plan here which describes the logic for solve(), and includes the pattern#, steps involved and reasoning, error handling and fallback options. You must include how you are relying on cached result when running out of lifelines>

    """
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Convert characters to ASCII values. Usage: input={"input": {"string": "INDIA"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"string": "INDIA"}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)
    numbers = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FUNCTION_CALL: 2
    """Sum exponentials of int list. Usage: input={"input": {"numbers": [65, 66, 67]}} result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"numbers": numbers}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)
    final_result = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FINAL_RESULT
    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"

```

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Validate PLAN against rules.
- Follow exact Usage docstring format for tool calls.
- Use only available tools from Tool Catalog.
- Call tools by name (await mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)).
- Precede calls with full docstring ("""docstring""").
- Use function signature (tool(input)).
- Parse dependent results (parsed = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]). (NEVER use ["results"], ALWAYS USE ["result"])
- Never inline json.loads(...) in f-strings; assign to variable first.
- NEVER parse document/webpage chunks to look for FINAL_ANSWER OR chain more tools based on result, always return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {tool_result}"
- NEVER return document/webpage chunks OR ERROR in FINAL_ANSWER.
- NEVER return FINAL_ANSWER without the user query being solved if you have steps left to try out.
