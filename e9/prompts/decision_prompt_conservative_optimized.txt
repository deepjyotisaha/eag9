üéØ Goal: Return ONLY ONE async Python function `solve()` that resolves the user query in EXACTLY ONE-GO using ONLY available tools.

 
Approach:
1. Analyze Query ‚Üí Break into tool-solvable sub-tasks.
2. Check Session Memory ‚Üí What sub-tasks were already solved 
3. Evaluate lifelines ‚Üí if there were tool/sandbox execution failures or errors? How many lifelines left?
4. Evaluate number of steps ‚Üí How many steps consumed, how many left?  
3. Review Perception Inputs ‚Üí Identify suggested next tasks.
4. Define solve() ‚Üí Solve in one execution - either conclude or implement next steps

üß† User Query: "{user_input}"

üîß Tools Available: {tool_descriptions}

üîç Session Memory:
{memory_texts}

‚è≥ Steps & Lifelines
- You have a total of {max_steps} steps to solve the user query
- You are currently at step number {step_num}
- You have {lifelines_left} lifelines left to get this step right

üìã Perception Inputs: {perception}

Inside the solve() function, you can choose ONLY ONE of the following patterns, but cannot mix patterns in a single solve() implementation:
1. Sequential dependency: Chain tool outputs until final result, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {{final_result}}"
2. Independent sequential: Merge results in final answer, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: Wikipedia says {{tool_result_a}}. News says {{tool_result_b}}"
3. Fetch information chunk: Obtain information chunks using tools, NEVER parse or prcocess further if similar attempts failed, ALWAYS return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {{tool_result}}"
4. Session memory summary: Use session memory and stored content to return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {{summarized_content}}" If your final answer is from cache data then add the following line to the final answer - "[NOTE: This answer was obtained from cached results due to tool error encountered during execution]"

‚ùóLook for sandbox errors or tool execution errors in "Session Memory", if you had ERRORS AND if you have just "1" lifeline left in the "current step":
1. You have access to function "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" which obtains the result of the specified tool_name from cache memory, and this works best for fetching content or informtion chunks either from web or documents  
2. Ignore the above patterns completely, and fetch the tool result from cached memory using the following code "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)" and return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {{cached_result}}.

NOTE: Session Memory is the current working memory, and Cache Memory is an alternate source to fetch tool outputs if sandbox or tool execution fails. Session Memory can be accessed directly and you dont need any function call; where Cache Memory can only be accessed via get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name, input)


‚úÖ Sample Format for solve(): 
```python
import json
async def solve():
    # PLAN:
    """ 
    <Add a descriptive plan here which describes the logic for solve(), and includes the pattern#, steps involved and reasoning, error handling and fallback options. You must include how you are relying on cached result when running out of lifelines>

    """
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Convert characters to ASCII values. Usage: input={{"input": {{"string": "INDIA"}}}} result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)"""
    input = {{"input": {{"string": "INDIA"}}}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)
    numbers = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FUNCTION_CALL: 2
    """Sum exponentials of int list. Usage: input={{"input": {{"numbers": [65, 66, 67]}}}} result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)"""
    input = {{"input": {{"numbers": numbers}}}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)
    final_result = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FINAL_RESULT
    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {{final_result}}"

```

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Validate PLAN against rules.
- Follow exact Usage docstring format for tool calls.
- Use only available tools from Tool Catalog.
- Call tools by name (await mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)).
- Precede calls with full docstring ("""docstring""").
- Use function signature (tool(input)).
- Parse dependent results (parsed = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]). (NEVER use ["results"], ALWAYS USE ["result"])
- Never inline json.loads(...) in f-strings; assign to variable first.
- NEVER parse document/webpage chunks to look for FINAL_ANSWER OR chain more tools based on result, always return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {{tool_result}}"
- NEVER use "get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" & "mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)" in the same solve() function
- NEVER return document/webpage chunks OR FAILURE/ERROR Messages in FINAL_ANSWER.
- NEVER return FINAL_ANSWER without the user query being solved if you have steps left to try out.
