üéØ Goal: Return ONLY ONE async Python function `solve()` that resolves the user query in EXACTLY ONE-GO using ONLY available tools.

 
Approach:
1. Analyze Query ‚Üí Break into tool-solvable sub-tasks.
2. Check Session Memory ‚Üí What sub-tasks were already solved 
3. Evaluate lifelines ‚Üí if there were tool/sandbox execution failures or errors? How many lifelines left?
4. Evaluate number of steps ‚Üí How many steps consumed, how many left?  
3. Review Perception Inputs ‚Üí Identify suggested next tasks.
4. Define solve() ‚Üí Solve in one execution.

üß† User Query: "{user_input}"

üîß Tools Available: {tool_descriptions}

üîç Session Memory:
{memory_texts}

‚è≥ Steps & Lifelines
- You have a total of {max_steps} steps to solve the user query
- You are currently at step number {step_num}
- You have currently {lifelines_left} lifelines left for the current step

üìã Perception Inputs: {perception}

You can choose ONE of the following patterns inside the solve() function based on what is needed to answer the user query:
1. Sequential dependency: Chain tool outputs until final result, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {{final_result}}"
2. Independent sequential: Merge results in final answer, return f"FINAL_ANSWER: Wikipedia says {{tool_result_a}}. News says {{tool_result_b}}"
3. Fetch information chunk: Obtain information chunks using tools, don't parse or prcocess further if previous result failed, ALWAYS return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {{tool_result}}"
4. Session memory summary: Use session memory and stored content to return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {{summarized_content}}" If your final answer is from cache data then add the following line to the final answer - "[NOTE: This answer was obtained from cached results due to tool error encountered during execution]"

‚ùó Sandbox Error or Tool Execution Error Handling:
1. If sandbox encounters error during execution OR if the tool execition fails - then you cannot obtain an answer via "mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)". 
2. If you have encountered sandbox error OR tool execution error AND have tried atleast twice, you might have just 1 lifeline left - In such cases ALWAYS directly substitute tool results using "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name). DONT call "mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)" again. 
3. get_tool_results_from_cache() works best for fetching content or informtion chunks either from web or documents 
4. Never parse the cached_result and ALWAYS DIRECTLY return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {{cached_result}}. 
5. You MUST first obtain the cached_result using "cached_result = get_tool_results_from_cache(tool_name)" before returning it. 


‚úÖ Sample Format for solve(): 
```python
import json
async def solve():
    # PLAN:
    """ 
    <Add a descriptive plan here which describes the logic for solve(), and includes the pattern#, steps involved and reasoning, error handling and fallback options. You must include how you are relying on cached result when running out of lifelines>

    """
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Convert characters to ASCII values. Usage: input={{"input": {{"string": "INDIA"}}}} result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)"""
    input = {{"input": {{"string": "INDIA"}}}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)
    numbers = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FUNCTION_CALL: 2
    """Sum exponentials of int list. Usage: input={{"input": {{"numbers": [65, 66, 67]}}}} result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)"""
    input = {{"input": {{"numbers": numbers}}}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)
    final_result = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FINAL_RESULT
    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {{final_result}}"

```

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Validate PLAN against rules.
- Follow exact Usage docstring format for tool calls.
- Use only available tools from Tool Catalog.
- Call tools by name (await mcp.call_tool('tool_name', input)).
- Precede calls with full docstring ("""docstring""").
- Use function signature (tool(input)).
- Parse dependent results (parsed = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]). (NEVER use ["results"], ALWAYS USE ["result"])
- Never inline json.loads(...) in f-strings; assign to variable first.
- NEVER parse document/webpage chunks to look for FINAL_ANSWER OR chain more tools based on result, always return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {{tool_result}}"
- NEVER return document/webpage chunks OR ERROR in FINAL_ANSWER.
- NEVER return FINAL_ANSWER without the user query being solved if you have steps left to try out.
